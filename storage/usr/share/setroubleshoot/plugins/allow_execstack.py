    SELinux is preventing $SOURCE_PATH from making the program stack executable.

    The $SOURCE application attempted to make its stack
    executable.  This is a potential security problem.  This should
    never ever be necessary. Stack memory is not executable on most
    OSes these days and this will not change. Executable stack memory
    is one of the biggest security problems. An execstack error might
    in fact be most likely raised by malicious code. Applications are
    sometimes coded incorrectly and request this permission.  The
    <a href="http://people.redhat.com/drepper/selinux-mem.html">SELinux Memory Protection Tests</a>
    web page explains how to remove this requirement.  If $SOURCE does not
    work and you need it to work, you can configure SELinux
    temporarily to allow this access until the application is fixed. Please 
file a bug report.
    ''')
    
    fix_description = _('''
    Sometimes a library is accidentally marked with the execstack flag,
    if you find a library with this flag you can clear it with the
    execstack -c LIBRARY_PATH.  Then retry your application.  If the
    app continues to not work, you can turn the flag back on with
    execstack -s LIBRARY_PATH.  Otherwise, if you trust $SOURCE to
    run correctly, you can change the context of the executable to
    execmem_exec_t. "chcon -t execmem_exec_t
    '$SOURCE_PATH'"
    You must also change the default file context files on the system in order to preserve them even on a full relabel.  "semanage fcontext -a -t execmem_exec_t '$FIX_SOURCE_PATH'"

    SELinux has denied the $SOURCE the ability to mmap low area of the kernel 
    address space.  The ability to mmap a low area of the address space, as 
    configured by /proc/sys/kernel/mmap_min_addr.  Preventing such mappings 
    helps protect against exploiting null deref bugs in the kernel. All 
    applications that need this access should have already had policy written

    would be generated. This is a serious issue. Your system may very well be

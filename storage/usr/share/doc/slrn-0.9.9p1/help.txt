% help.txt, completely rewritten by Matthias Friedrich <matt@mafr.de>,
% based on the slrn reference manual and the original help.txt.

% This file may be viewed on-line by SLRN by pointing the environment variable
% SLRNHELP to it.  It is particlularly useful when you modify the default
% keybindings and you want the on-line help to reflect this fact.

% The format of the file is simple.  Lines that start with `%' are comment
% lines and will be ignored.  Any line that consists entirely of whitespace
% is also ignored.
% cpp Macros may be used but are only useful in combination with the
% makehelp script, which is used to generate the documentation in help.c
% from this file.

% The file is divided into sections.  A section is started by the presence of
% a line that contains a name enclosed in brackets.  Currently, the only
% names formed in this manner are [Article] and [Group].  The text that
% follows one of these names will be displayed as the help screen for that 
% particular mode.

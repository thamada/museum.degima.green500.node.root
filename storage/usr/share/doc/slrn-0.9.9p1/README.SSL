SLRN may be used to access a secure server using SSL.  To do this, SSL
support must be enabled.

Compiling SLRN with SSL support
-------------------------------

To build slrn with SSL support, you must first obtain and install the
OpenSSL library from http://www.openssl.org.  Beware that some
countries may have import/export regulations concerning such software.
If you get arrested, do not call me!  Just as important, do not
contact me if you have trouble compiling OpenSSL --- I have nothing to
do with the development of OpenSSL.

After installing OpenSSL, configure slrn for SSL support, e.g.,

   ./configure --with-ssl

By default, OpenSSL will install itself in /usr/local/ssl.  If you
install it elsewhere, e.g., $HOME/ssl, then use:

   ./configure --with-ssl=$HOME/ssl

After compiling it, `slrn --version' should indicate SSL support.


Using SLRN with secure servers
------------------------------

As far as slrn is concerned, only those servers whose names are
prefixed with "snews://" are secure and require SSL.  So,
to access a secure server such as netscape's secnews.netscape.com,
simply prefix the NNTP host name with "snews://".  For instance, 

   slrn -h snews://secnews.netscape.com --create

In your .slrnrc file, you may want to add a line such as:

   server "snews://secnews.netscape.com" ".newsrc-netscape"

to indicate that the file ".newsrc-netscape" should be used for this
server.

That's it!

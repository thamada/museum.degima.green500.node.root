preupgrade - tool to help you update a fedora system from one distro to the
             next. Pre-resolves dependencies and sets up the system to be
             upgraded via anaconda

= NOTES =

== Cleanup ==
preupgrade modifies data in ~3 places:
  /var/cache/yum/preupgrade*
  /boot/upgrade
  /etc/grub.conf

If you want to clean up manually, you can do:
  preupgrade --clean
Or, if you really want to be sure, do it by hand:
  grubby --remove-kernel=/boot/upgrade/vmlinuz
  rm -rf /var/cache/yum/preupgrade* /boot/upgrade

== Remote Headless Upgrades ==
Use preupgrade-cli --vnc=VNCPASSWORD.
See preupgrade-cli --help for more info.
The upgrade will start a VNC server on port 5901, requiring the given password.
The upgrade will proceed whether you connect the VNC client or not.

--> IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT VNC INSTALLS <--
If something goes wrong or the installer needs more info, it will hang forever,
waiting for you to tell it what to do. So you should probably connect a VNC
client and monitor its progress.

== Adding Custom Distributions ==
preupgrade searches the following locations for release data, in order:
  ./releases.txt
  ./data/releases.txt
  http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/releases.txt
If you want to add your own distribution to preupgrade: download releases.txt,
edit it to your liking, then run preupgrade from that dir - or save it to
~/releases.txt to make it work when preupgrade is run normally.


Please note that /usr/share/preupgrade/releases.list is ignored and is only
being shipped for compatibility reasons. Use ~/releases.txt for customization.

The outlines of this font are from the Sinhala LaTeX pagkage:

  http://www.ocs.mq.edu.au/~vsaparam/sinhala.html

Quoted from the README of that package:

  "This is a package of Metafont fonts and a preprocessor suitable for
  writing Sinhala script using TeX or LaTeX.  This package was
  originally developed by Yannis Haralambous (Yannis.Haralambous at
  univ-lille1 fr), with funding from the Wellcome Institute for the
  History of Medicine, 183 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE, England (Contact
  person: Dominik Wujastyk (D.Wujastyk at ucl ac uk)), which is using
  the font in its Catalogue of Sinhala Manuscript. The original package
  was available by ftp at ftp.bcc.ac.uk in:

  /pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/software/sinhala1-TeX.zip

  It was later modified by Vasantha Saparamadu (vsaparam at ocs mq edu
  au) to add support for 'samanala' transliteration scheme developed by
  Prasad Dharmasena (pkd at isr umd edu)."

LKLUG font was created by Anuradha Ratnaweera (anuradha at taprobane
org) and Harshani Devadithya using the outlines of the above font and
adding OTF table entries.

"Kunddaliya", "dotted circle", "zero width non-joiner", "zero width joiner"
glyphs created and OTF tables modified by Harshula Jayasuriya
(harshula at gmail dot com).

Debian packaging was reviewed and improved by Anuradha Weeraman and
NIIBE Yutaka.

The LKLUG font was created completely using FontForge
(http://fontforge.sourceforge.net).

libbeagle is a standalone C library interface to the Beagle desktop
search and indexing system.  Users of libbeagle can search the Beagle
indexes as well as send data to the service to be indexed.  Although
the Beagle daemon is written using C# and Mono, there is no Mono
dependency when using this library.

Also included are Python bindings to libbeagle.

+ Short term, high priority
- Short term, low priority
* Long term

=> General:
   + UI and terminology review.

=> Server:
   - Implement cliboard handling
   - Review the screen polling implementation.
   - Use the debugging utils for libvncserver debugging.
   - Why don't we get the hostname in the prompt dialog ?
   - Get libvncserver patches upstream.
   * Use the XDAMAGE extension.
   * Investigate if we can conjure up a nice cursor from the
     current theme using the XCursor library. 
   * Investigate using the XFIXES cursor image support.
   * Talk to keith about getting cursor position
     notification support too.
   * Investigate if using TLS compression gives us any gains.
   * Implement service discovery and registration using MDNS
     and DNS-SD.

=> Client:
   + Native gtk+ based client
   + i18n support for Java client ?
   * Could we make the Java client support all pixel formats, or
     at least 8 bit colour as well as 24 bit colour?

=> Security:
   - Export control ?
   * Implement support for server certificate and client
     certificate authentication.
   * Kerberos support ?

=> Bugs
   + Fix the screen size-changed handling. We seem to not get
     the ConfigureNotify on the root window for ages and thus
     get a BadMatch when we try and do a GetImage with the
     wrong size image.

=> Protocol
   - Document the TLS security type
   * Multi-screen support ?

TODO list
=========

The ELinks TODO items are kept in Bugzilla <http://bugzilla.elinks.cz/>;
look for the bugs with 'enhancement' severity. More general goals are
still kept here, though, to be more visible to developers. ;-) Finally,
the code contains several (greppable) "FIXME" and "TODO" notes regarding
smaller fixes and enhancements.

General goals:

 - Write more documentation; docs, a lot of docs!

 - General code cleanup

 - Speed/memory optimizations

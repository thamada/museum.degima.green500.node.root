  Patches from Witold Filipczyk for node detection algorithms in man
  and info.
  Added default item on search prompt.
  Bugfix in info link freeing procedure, which failed on exim pages.
  Bugfix for dir page lookup when several matches are found--there was
  a double close() problem.
0.6.7    
  Added scrolling in left/right direction (!!!new config file keys).
  Fixed handling of info entries like `emacs21/emacs'--modified
  function matchfile().
  Added autmatical detection of rawfilename for filenames beginning
  with `../', `./', `/' in main().
  Added support for '(gcc)Introduction' like specification of nodes.
0.6.6    
  bugfixes for userdefined rcfile and configuration inconsistences
  added sorting of matches for the info file to display
0.6.5    
  Fixed bug in sorting of tag table links (major effect to the engine)
  Changed the file search engine to scan the directory for a matching
  pattern (instead of trying various propositions).
  Fixed minor sigsegv bug in page loader (link initializer).
  !Added switching between sections in manualviewer mode

  'context' for currently viewed file. Pinfo will search files for
  one set of infopages only in one directory--in the context directory.
  The context can be changed only when changing the set of infopages.

  info.
  Fixed problem with pinforc installed to non-exsisting etc directory
  Fixed problem with black bar on first man page

  Added texinfo documentation.
  Manual code is now case insensitive as far as sections are considered
0.6.0    
  Replaced evil `myclrtoeol' with `bkgdset+clrtoeol'

0.5.9
  Setenv()->putenv() (so pinfo can now compile without problems
  at nonlinux unices)

  Added KEY_CTRL and KEY_ALT macros, which enable you to use CTRL+x
  and ALT+x combinations. (the ALT+x is probably only usable on linux
  console, but who knows ;)
  Fixed global regexp search code. It now searches every two following
  lines, to avoid returning of expressions, which are several hounderts
  lines long ;)
  Added STDERR-REDIRECTION config file option, which allows you to
  specify how do you wish to redirect stderr from plug-ins.
  Added support for long section names in manual code. Now, if your
  system supports it, you can make use of section names like

  LONG-MANUAL-LINKS config option).
  Added regexp search wrapper for systems which don't support it.
0.5.2

  node at the bottom(top) of viewed node. Also added support for
  0 key value.
  Fixed one bug in $INFOPATH handler.
  Added support for hypertextualization of weird man sections 
  (i.e. 3X11, 3Xt, etc. -- it's configurable)

  maileditor.
  Added national language support for Swedish and Czech.

  Added new feature to key_goto -- now when you pass there
  a name, ending with `.info', then key_goto will move you not
  to specified node, but to specified info document.
  Locale support now is working (see at the example with polish
  translation).
  Added key_dir
  Fixed support for xterm mouse.
0.4.9    
  Corrected global search code for inirect info files (that is those,
  split up across several info files). It works fine now.
0.4.8    
  You can now browse man pages from different sections.
0.4.7    
  After a week of contignous fight I've... FIXED the nasty bug, which
  caused so many sigsegvs! I'm really happy :)) And what about you? ;)
  But locales at present send sigsegvs anyway ;)
  I also added a program `testkey' for making it possible to obtain
  keycode values for weird keys for config file.
0.4.6    
  Fixed many bugs connected with v0.4.5.
  Started working on locale stuff. But for now it only causes
  unexpected segmentation faults ;)
0.4.5    
  HUGE change. I reimplemented the info handling routines so, that
  there is now possible to use links across different info files.
  Thanks to this I could also implement a handler for 'dir' page.
  Huh... I can't belive it works ;)
0.4.4    
  Made a wrapper for readline function. I just can't implement
  readline handling properly under ncurses, so you'd rather use
  this wrapper. It's not to advanced yet, but implements primary
  things, thich readline deals with (history, and line editing).
  I'm working on tab completion.
0.4.3    
  Added support for infos without tag table. Modified man page.
0.4.2    
  Modified use of readline lib. It doesn't require to use ltermcap
  anymore, and does not need to close curses screen... This was
  quite difficult task ;)
  Added support for resizing screen 'on the fly' (i.e. in x window).
  Added support for ncurses mouse (which works in xterm).
0.4.1    
  Recreated mechanism of opening info file. Now it is possible
  to add new compression methods for info by just modyfing two
  variables on the top of filehandling_functions.c. Also I've
  added support for national info pages, which may be located
  in the directory $INFOPATH/$LANG. (ie. for polish info pages
  that could be /usr/info/pl_PL/infopage.info)
  Added support for cutting off manual headers (--cut-man-headers)
  Added some nodeposition informations in status bar.
0.4.0    
  Support for apropos. Searches finally work properly.
0.3.9    
  Gnu Readline support. Now you can browse history on regexp 
  searchs    ;). Added sigblock on sigpipe. Now you can safely open
  pipes to programs which don't exist.
0.3.8    
  Added configuration file support. Fixed one bug. Expanded manual
  page :)
0.3.7    
  Added option --manual, and --raw-filename. Added support for
  8-bit characters (i.e. national characters for certain charsets).
  Modified regexp search on manuals. Bold/italic tokens are recognized
  now.
0.3.6    
  Added possibility to call shell commands from within pinfo.
  Modified a bit makefile. Source does not use the 'dangerous' ;)
  sprintf anymore. Fixed minor bugs.
0.3.5    
  Fixed some more sigsegv bugs.
0.3.4    
  Fixed some stupid bugs in manual code. Added new comments to source.
  (since I almost got lost myself ;)
0.3.3    
  Speedup modifications. I.e. window is not refreshed now when
  key buffer is not empty (to avoid scrolling, when the key is
  already depressed, and to make it work better on slow terminals).
0.3.2    
  Added support for the refresh (^L) key.
0.3.1    
  Added possibility to redefine keys (at compile-time). Modified
  man page hypertext recognization (now it recognizes everything of
  the form 'something (x) or something (xy)'. Removed bug with
  regex.h in manual.c.
0.3.0    
  Manuals can be read now as well as info files, when info cannot be
  found. Manuals can be browsed similar to infos; hyperlinks are
  the fields od form 'something (x)' (according to the common format at
  SEE ALSO section). Since the change is quite big, I've moved the
  version number to 0.3.0.
0.2.4    
  Added regexp searching -- '/' option and 's' option.
0.2.3    
  Tiny change -- added some checking for mvaddstr functions, so they
  don't drop core if there's no menu/note token.
0.2.2    
  Added support for old curses (macro definition ___OLD_CURSES___,
  enabled in Makefile. That was enough to compile this program
  under HP-UX :)
0.2.1    
  Added support for "index menus", and all other of the format
  "* blabla:[optional spaces]node.". Added cache for menu/note
  highlight positions. Also code is a bit modified; to be precise
  I started to clarify it a bit by adding macros, and other
  things, to get as close to short'n'clear procedures, as possible.
0.2.0    
  The engine for hypertext recognization is reimplemented. Support for
  notes and menus of format : node. is added. Also color support is
  added. Also added some cache for menuchecking and notechecking
  functs.
0.1.5    
  Fixed bug with not deleting files from /tmp; added $INFOPATH support
0.1.4    
  Added 'g' key
0.1.3    
  Added pgdn/pgup/home/end keys
0.1.2    
  Added support for notes of kind note::
0.1.1    
  First working engine; menus of kind menu:: are supported [12.III.1999]
0.0.0    
  I'm angry, because the only docs considering my problem (gtk) are in
  info format, and I just can't work with standard info ;-)

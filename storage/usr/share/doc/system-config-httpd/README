Overview
========

In order for newcomers to configure an Apache web server without too much
hazle we have put together this nice little tool.

It is based on a newly developed base component called alchemist. The
alchemist is the backend which to put it in simple terms manages all
configurations in a tool independant manner and is capable of handling and
merging multiple XML based configurations. Apacheconf simply uses it as a
storage and data handling backend.

Apacheconf itself is a Python 1.5 program using the pygtk, pygnome and
pygnome-libglade to do the whole UI work.

With system-config-httpd you can edit your HTTPD server configuration.



Design
======

In order to separate the different modules we have differentiated everything
in the following order:

  UI                                Glade 

  UI Interface                    ApacheConf

  UI <-> Gizmo Interface        ApacheControl  

  Gizmo <-> Base Interface       ApacheGizmo 

  Base <-> Alchemist Interface   ApacheBase

  Data storage                    Alchemist


The idea was to have the middleware part (ApacheControl, ApacheGizmo and
ApacheBase) separated in two parts: One part for the frontend (GUI), the other
for the backend (Alchemist).

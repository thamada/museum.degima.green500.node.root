Enabling scaling
================

 - Current version (2.25 an up):
  Scaling should be working out-of-the-box, as it relies on cairo, and cairo
  is present on most platforms. Note that gtk-vnc >= 0.3.8 is required.

 - Older versions (2.24 and earlier):
  In order to enable scaling in Vinagre, gtk-vnc widget must have been
  compiled with this feature enabled. Just build gtk-vnc with the flag
  '--with-gtkglext=yes', in the configure stage.

Bookmarks
=========

  - In Vinagre 2.23.3 we have moved the bookmarks file location from ~/.gnome2
  to ~/.local/share/vinagre, which is the recommended place for data files.
  The change should be transparent, i.e., we automatically copy the old file
  to the new place if we detect that new file does not exist yet.

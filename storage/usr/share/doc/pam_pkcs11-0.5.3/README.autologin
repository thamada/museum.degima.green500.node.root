EXTRACTING LOGIN FROM CERTIFICATE HOWTO
---------------------------------------

Starting at pam_pkcs11-0.4.2 a new feature is provided: pam-pkcs11 can
deduce user name from certificate, without login prompt.

This is done when pam_get_user() call returns null or empty string.
In this case, pam-pcks11 use the module mapper "find" feature instead
of normal "match".

If the finder list returns ok, evaluated user is set to pam via
pam_set_item(PAM_USER) call, and PAM_AUTH_OK is returned.

So there are no longer need to enter user name if a certificate is
provided and can be mapped to an user.


There are to ways to use this feature:

a) Patch "gdm" and "login" programs to detect card presence and return
null as user name, without prompt for an user login.
This is a work to be done :-(

b) Use unpatched versions, and do the following procedures:

b.1) When login from console, just enter " " (space) + Enter. 

b.2) When login from gdm, just key Enter at login prompt. 

In both cases the procedure continues as:
- If a card is not present, login will ask for password, and gdm will
  prompt again for user login

- If a card is present, pam-pkcs11 will ask for the PIN, and then invoke
  finder in module mapper list. When a user is found, this user becomes
  the logged user

This feature can be used with pam-mkhomedir.so PAM Session module.
In this case, you can create on-the-fly accounts. This scenario is
ideal for centralized auth services (Winbind, ldap, kerberos, RDBMS auth...)

As example, here comes my tested /etc/pam.d/gdm file:
#%PAM-1.0
auth       sufficient   pam_pkcs11.so debug config_file=/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf
auth       required     pam_env.so
auth       required     pam_stack.so service=system-auth
auth       required     pam_nologin.so
account    required     pam_stack.so service=system-auth
password   required     pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    required     pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    optional     pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel umask=0022
session    optional     pam_console.so

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 
For pam_set_item(PAM_USER) success, application using pam must have
enought permissions. If this condition is not met, setting user process
will fail and proper log message registered. So this feature is mainly
provided for logging processes running as root.

Improper mapper chain configurations with unauthorized certificates can
lead in the creation of fake accounts in the system if pam_mkhomedir.so
module is used. So be really carefull when authenticating users directly
from certificates.

Enjoy!

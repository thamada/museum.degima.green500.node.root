        <p><font size="+1"><b>Random polygons appear throughout display while playing Doom 3</b></font></p>

		<p>This information applies to the following system configurations:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>ATI Proprietary Linux Driver 3.14.1 and earlier</li>
		    <li>Doom 3 Linux Client by ID Software</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Doom 3 will launch properly, but the game menu will appear corrupt, as will gameplay. Alternately, the menu may appear normally, but the display will become completely corrupt shortly into normal gameplay.</p>
		
		<p>Random polygons will appear all over the display. Keyboard and mouse control should not be affected.</p>

		<p>This issue has been resolved in the 3.14.6 hotfix driver.</p>

<P><B>3D Linux applications corrupt or hang with "force multi-sample visuals" enabled</B></P>
</FONT>

<p>This information applies to the following system configurations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ATI Proprietary Linux Driver 3.7.1 and later</li>
    <li>"force multi-sample visuals" option enabled in fglrxconfig</li>
</ul>

<p>A 3D window might appear normally, but will corrupt the contents of any other window placed above it.</p>

<p>The 3D display may also appear corrupt. Lines, polygons, and highlights will be visible, but textures will not. The application is not usable in this state and may crash after a few seconds.</p>

<p>This issue does not occur on all systems or monitor configurations. Symptoms may vary between different applications.</p>

<p>ATI Engineering is aware of this issue and is investigating. Updates will appear on this page when they become available.</p>

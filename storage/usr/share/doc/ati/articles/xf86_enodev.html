<P><B>X Fails to load on systems with Linux kernel version 2.6.x</B></P>
</FONT>

<p>This information applies to the following system configurations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Linux kernel version 2.6.x</li>
    <li>Any ATI Linux driver</li>
</ul>

<p>A blank screen may appear momentarily when X starts to load. The following error message (or similar) may appear on the text console or in /var/log/XFree86.0.log:</p>

<tt>(EE) fglrx(0): [agp] unable to acquire AGP, error ""xf86_ENODEV""</tt>

<p>This is not a problem with the display driver.</p>

<p>Version 2.6 kernels require a second kernel module in addition to agpgart, which should be named similar to the manufacturer of your motherboard AGP chipset. This error message should occur if the other agp module is not loaded.</p>

<p>This issue can be worked around as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>First make sure that <a href="4483.html">agpgart is loading properly</a>.</li>

<li><p>To find out which AGP controller your motherboard uses, issue the following command:</p>
<tt>lspci | grep AGP</tt></li>

<li><p>To find a list of AGP related kernel modules installed on your machine, issue the following command and look for a module (*.ko file) that suits your AGP Controller:</p>
<tt>ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/agp</tt></li>

<li><p>Use the <tt>modprobe</tt> command (as root) to load the module. For example: On a motherboard using a VIA&reg; AGP Controller, you would load the via-agp.ko using modprobe as follows (notice that the trailing .ko is omitted):</p>
<tt>modprobe via-agp</tt></li>

<p>Check the modprobe manpage for more information on loading kernel modules.</p>

<li><P>To verify that the AGP module is already loaded, run <tt>lsmod</tt> as root. With the XServer running and the connection established, the usage count of this module must be greater than zero.</P></li>

</ol>

<p>If cannot find a suitable agp module for your motherboard, then you may want to upgrade to the latest version of the Linux kernel, or check your motherboard manufacturer's website for more information.</p>

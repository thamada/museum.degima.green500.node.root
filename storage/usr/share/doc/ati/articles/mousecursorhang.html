        <p>This information applies to the following system configurations:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>ATI Proprietary Linux Driver 3.14.1 or earlier</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>While moving the mouse around on the screen, the system will hang. This will happen just when the mouse cursor image is about to change.</p>
		
		<p>This issue is most likely to occur when numerous windows are open and many things are happening on the screen simultaneously.</p>
		
		<p>This issue has been resolved in the 3.14.6 hotfix driver.</p>

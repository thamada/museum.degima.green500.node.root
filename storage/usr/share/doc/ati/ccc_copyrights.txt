TrueType font support. These functions allow PPR to generate PostScript fonts from Microsoft compatible TrueType font files.

The functions in this file do most of the work to convert a TrueType font to a type 3 PostScript font.

Most of the material in this file is derived from a program called "ttf2ps" which L. S. Ng posted to the usenet news group "comp.sources.postscript". The author did not provide a copyright notice or indicate any restrictions on use.

Qt supports GIF reading if it is configured that way during installation. If it is, we are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

Warning: If you are in a country that recognizes software patents and in which Unisys holds a patent on LZW compression and/or decompression and you want to use GIF, Unisys may require you to license that technology. Such countries include Canada, Japan, the US, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.

GIF support may be removed completely in a future version of Qt. We recommend using the MNG or PNG format.

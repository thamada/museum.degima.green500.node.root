<P><A NAME="monitor config"></A><B>Monitor Configuration</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">The driver supports
the following monitor configurations. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">Single Head:
	Single monitor operation only. If a second monitor is connected, it
	remains dark. This is the only available display mode setting if you
	have only one monitor connected. This is further the only mode Quad
	Buffer Stereo (&quot;Active Stereo&quot;) is working. 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">Clone: The
	contents of the primary monitor are duplicated on the second
	monitor. If one monitor cannot display the selected resolution, a
	lower resolution is automatically selected for this monitor. The
	original resolution is used then as it was specified as the virtual
	resolution. This means the second screen will do panning when the
	mouse moves ahead. The configuration file contains only one Screen
	section and one Monitor section. The Monitor specific data for the
	secondary display is handled by the Hsync2, Vrefresh2, and Mode2
	options. Custom modes are only applied to the the primary display.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 100%">Big Desktop:
	There is a single big frame buffer that gets split either
	horizontally or vertically and each half is sent to a single
	monitor. The configuration file contains only one Screen section and
	one Monitor section. The Monitor specific data for the secondary
	display is handled by the Hsync2, Vrefresh2, and Mode2 options.
	Custom modes are only applied to the primary display.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="line-height: 100%">Mirror: Both displays are driven by
	the primary CRTC and they operate at the same display mode. When two
	monitors have different capabilities, the mode validation will fall
	back to the highest common mode that can be supported by both
	monitors. Note that in some cases two displays cannot be driven by
	the same CRTC, then two controllers will automatically be used.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="line-height: 100%">Dual Head: In this mode, the X
	server is configured to have two screens on two different channels
	of the same adapter. In other words in the configuration file there
	will be two Monitor sections and two Screen sections. This will
	create two independent desktops managed by the window manager. Since
	the DRI module has problems with Xinerama the driver does not
	support extended desktop with Xinerama. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="line-height: 100%">By default any physically connected
display will be initialized under Clone mode (if possible) in display
priority order during X server startup. This behavior can be
overridden through the use of the ForceMonitors feature.
ForceMonitors can be used to set all specified displays to enabled or
disabled regardless of physical connection. For example, suppose a
CRT and a DFP are physically connected. It is possible through
ForceMonitors to disable the DFP and force STV to on. The STV could
then be physically connected at a later time for viewing. When using
ForceMonitors with an unconnected CRT the default behavior will be to
initialize the display in 1024x768 resolution. Since the monitor is
not connected the EDID information cannot be determined, as a result
the driver initializes the display safe mode. In order to override
this behavior a custom mode or custom sync ranges must be set for
this CRT display.</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 100%">The driver supports any combination of
two connected displays, such as CRT/DFP, CRT/STV, CRT/CRT, etc. More
then two connected displays may operate correctly but is not
officially supported at this time. The assignment of primary and
secondary display is done through priority order, which is LCD, DFP
on internal TMDS, DFP2, DFP on external TMDS, STV, CV, CRT on primary
DAC, and CRT on secondary DAC respectively. In order to determine
which displays are connected examine the var/log/XFree86.0.log (or
Xorg.0.log) file and look for the Display1 through DisplayN tags.
These tags will describe which displays have been detected and the
respective hardware component that they have been attached to. Using
the information in the log file and the priority sequence the primary
and secondary displays can be derived. 
</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 100%">When configuring the TVOUT it is
important to set the TVFormat to the correct local broadcast
standard. By default this value will be determined by the video BIOS
but it is most likely has been assigned NTSC. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="mode selection"></A><B>Mode Selection</B></P>
<P>By default all VESA modes, EDID modes, and custom modes will be
enumerated for mode selection. A custom mode is defined as a mode
specified by a Modeline in the Monitor section of the configuration
file. Custom modes take precedence over all other types of modes. If
a custom mode exists at a particular resolution then only custom
modes can be set at that resolution. Custom modes and custom sync range can only be applied
to DFP and CRT displays. In the case of Dual Head each Monitor
section will only have visibility of its own custom modes. If a CRT
display is connected and it does not have EDID information then this
display is enabled in 1024x768. To override this behavior use of
custom sync ranges or a custom modes must be employed. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The set of all modes that will be
enumerated is determined by the value of Modes and/or Mode2 depending
on the DesktopSetup. Note, the Modes setting is specified in the
Display sub-section whereas the Mode2 option is specified in the
Device section of the configuration file. The driver only supports
modes named by the following format, “&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;”.
For example, “1024x768” is a valid mode and “bob” or “1024
x 768” are invalid mode names. If the first mode in the mode
listing is not the largest specified mode then the X server will
start as a virtual desktop with pan and scan. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="refresh rate selection"></A><B>Refresh Rate Selection</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The PreferredVRefresh setting is used
to limit the maximum refresh rate that will be chosen when changing
modes. For example, if the resolution 1024x768 has 5 different
vertical refreshes, namely 100, 90, 80, 70, and 60, and the
PreferredVRefresh is 85 then a refresh rate of 80 Hz will be chosen
for this resolution. The default PreferredVRefresh is 85 Hz.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If custom refresh rates have been set
then they will override any refresh rate information obtained from
the EDID. Custom refresh rates should be used in the case of non-ddc
monitors or monitors with incorrect EDID data. The easiest way to
force the setting of a particular mode is to use a custom mode.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Custom modes can will also effect the
way in which refresh rates are selected. If there is a custom mode
set then the highest refresh rate at the custom mode resolution will
be chosen. This behavior only comes into effect when there is more
then one custom mode specified at a particular resolution. For
example, if two custom modes are specified at 1024x768, one is 60 Hz
and the other is 120 Hz, the 120 Hz mode will be chosen.

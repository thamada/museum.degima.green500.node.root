* cjet version 0.8.9, 22.02.1996
* symbol.h, symbol.c:  new PCL symbol sets: Desktop, MCText, VenturaUS,
  Ventura International, Ventura Math, PSText, PSMath. (Questionable 
  usefulness :))
  symbol set handling fixups: allow selection of characters from 
  more graphic sets to fill in missing characters. Characters in control
  code positions (not all, of course) are forceprinted as characters.

* cjet version 0.8.8 
* symbol.c: translate()
* fonts.c: ignore selection of nonexistent download fonts instead of
	   terminating abruptly
* misc.c: PrintControlChar()
* fixed(?) a download font problem: force printing of characters in control
  code areas; CaPSL can't always make up its little mind and loses some
  download characters on the first page; they started to appear somewhere
  in the middle of the page or else on the next page.

* cjet version 0.8.7, 17.01.1996

* pjl.c: new file: parse and ignore PJL sequences

* fonts.c: removed (obsolete?) PCL font descriptor warning

* function.c: added ESC &u # D (Set Units per Inch (PCL5e), added
  appropriate parsing structure in parse.c

* added ESC % # X Universal language exit (no-op)

* cjet version 0.8.5

  decompression buffer.

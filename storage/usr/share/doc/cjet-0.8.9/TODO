Missing / TODO:

- The character table for Ventura Math is probably not correct

- rearrange PCL font downloads in the middle of pages so that CaPSL doesn't
  eject the page in panic

- better page stuff handling ( sizes and such )

- PCL 5 text attribute stuff - ESC (s # S

- Macro and overlay stuff 

- HPGL support (some time)

- some sort of init file to set cassette paper size, default font, font 
  catridges etc.

What won't work :

- some PCL files (e.g. at least one file created by the Ljet3p driver
  in Windoze 3.1) download single characters in the middle of the page;
  CaPSL will eject the current page at that point

- Newer LaserJet models have more internal scalable fonts, the selection
  of which will be at best ignored.

- Reverse portrait / reverse landscape printing - ESC &l # O and ESC &a # P

- Some lesser known or obsolete symbol sets or sets supplied with external
  cartridges (which ones are obsolete ?) will not print correctly.

- download symbol sets - ESC*c # R, ESC*c # S, ESC (t or (f # W (?)
  (neither PCL nor CaPSL manuals available)

- PCL 5 transparency mode pattern stuff (Is it useful ? Does anybody use it ?)

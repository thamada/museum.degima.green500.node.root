gnome-pilot 2.0.15 'Alice', 2006-11-22
--------------------------------------

This is primarily a bugfix release, to patch issues that cropped up
with the new features introduced in version 2.0.14.

   - #357602.  Fix memory leak in the usbfs scanning code (with
	       thanks to Brian Warner)
   - #362565.  Add a 400ms pause between HAL detection of a USB
	       device and the first attempt to sync.  Several
	       devices were reported to reset themselves if
	       communication was attempted too soon after the
	       first appearance of the USB device.
   - #365181.  Fix a long-standing bug that probably turned up
	       now because of the multiple attempts to add a new
	       pilot due to #362565.  Avoid accessing freed memory
	       when the 'add pilot' dialog is opened multiple times.

Other changes:
   - Maintainership has passed from JP Rosevear to Matt Davey.
     Many thanks to JP for stepping in when gnome-pilot could
     otherwise have died a nasty death by abandonment.
   - #364589.  With thanks to Glynn Foster.  Tweaks to window
	       placement to support multihead displays.  Also,
	       added missing description to .server file for
	       panel applet.
   - Fix another long-standing bug, that could cause garbage to
     be shown when a configured conduit was unavailable (e.g.
     if the .conduit files were in the wrong place after an upgrade).
   - Fix distcheck target

gnome-pilot 2.0.14 'Felix', 2006-09-06
--------------------------------------
 
Significant changes:
   - Add support for libusb syncing with pilot-link 0.12.x
   - Fix network hotsync.  Use pilot-link to create the listen socket
     by binding to port "net:". (MD)
   - HAL is used by default for detecting USB connections (Jeffrey
     Stedfast, MD).  When HAL is not available, use /sys/bus/usb
     in preference to /proc/bus/usb (Martin Ammermueller, MD)
   - Fix applet message area, and fix transparency for applet panel icon.
   - Ported to the pilot-link 0.12.0 API, with continuing support for
     0.11.* (Mark Adams, Dave Malcolm, Veerapuram Varadhan, JP,
     others)
   - Big cleanup of the UI, to make it more compatible with the HIG.
     (Daniel Thompson, MD).
   - Improve robustness of binding, by attempting to connect multiple
     times.  This can solve problems where, for example, HAL
     notifications are received before the device is ready for binding
     (patch by Nathan Owens).
   - Support for international character sets, with pilot-link 0.12.x.
     Users should set the PILOT_CHARSET to an appropriate value (i.e.
     one recognised by iconv).

Many many bugfixes, including:
     * rh#189294: avoid using freed memory. (MD)
     * #113979: Support for non-UTF8 locales, using PILOT_CHARSET
     * #118328: applet does not show output of conduits
     * #130520: write backup_conduit exclude_files
		properly (Dennis Lambe Jr, JP)
     * #136010: gpilotd crashes when trying to backup NetLibrary (pilot-link-0.12.x)
     * #149063: gpilotd crashes if usbfs is not mounted
     * #151179: don't hard code static object files
     * #155888: gpilotd-control-applet doesn't follow HIG
     * #164728: use stock icon for applet (Gordon Ingram)
     * #173109: gnome-pilot doesn't compile with pilot-link 0.12.0-pre2
     * #309077: fix memory leaks (Mark Adams)
     * #309130: avoid memory leak and use of uninitialised memory
		in backup_conduit (Mark Adams)
     * #313203: put desktop file in non-deprecated location (MD)
     * #322903: Avoid trying to sync more than one USB device.(MD)
     * #322905, #322906: sanity check basedir and backupdir in
		capplet (Jerry Yu)
     * #328392: add missing variable init in backup_conduit (MD)
     * various build cleanups.
     * removed all compiler warnings up to gcc 3.x.(MD)

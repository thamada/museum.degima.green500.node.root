Devhelp information
===================

The following packages are required to compile Devhelp:

glib 2.10.0 (or greater)
gtk+ 2.10.0 (or greater)
libwnck 2.10.0 (or greater, only for X11 build)
gconf 2.6.0 (or greater, only for X11 build)
webkit

Devhelp's primary goal is to be an API documentation browser for
GNOME. When you build (or install) a GNOME library, it will build an
API reference for you and install it into:

  $datadir/gtk-doc/html/$PACKAGE. 

Along with the HTML files, a .devhelp and/or .devhelp2 index file is
also generated automatically. Thus Devhelp can simply scan that folder
for those index files and display the books they represent.

Devhelp uses the "XDG Base Directory Specification" to find
documentation. You can read more about that specification here:

  http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/

The list of locations searched for devhelp books is:

$XDG_DATA_HOME/devhelp/books
   e.g. /home/ross/.local/share/devhelp/books/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$XDG_DATA_HOME/gtk-doc/html
   e.g. /home/ross/.local/share/gtk-doc/html/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$XDG_DATA_DIRS/devhelp/books
   e.g. /usr/local/share/devhelp/books/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$XDG_DATA_DIRS/gtk-doc/html
   e.g. /usr/local/share/gtk-doc/html/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

Note that the two latter consist of: separated lists of directories to
look for. Those environment variables are normally set up by the
desktop environment or distribution.

Note that the name of the directory the .devhelp file is in and the
name of the .devhelp file (minus the extension) must match.

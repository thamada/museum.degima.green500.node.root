    ucm: delay freeing of active side UD cm object in case RTU is dropped
    
    The ucm was freeing the UD CM object to quickly so a retried REPLY
    was dropped and the passive side never received the AH info via RTU.
    Keep active side UD cm objects on work queue until QP is destroyed
    so RTU can be resent if necessary.

    With this delay in cm object queuing there is potential for replies
    being dropped coming back with a NO MATCH. Start with INIT
    state and queue it up, move to state REP_PENDING when
    sending out on the wire to start request timer.

    ucm: release UD cm objects after AH is exchanged to avoid duplicate request drops
    
    When EP is in UD mode, AH resolution is handled with DAT connection semantics
    connect and accept. Since AH info can be resolved for the same EPs you can
    get false duplicate requests because a previous CR from is still on the
    CM processing list. The CM object will remain on the EP free list and not
    be freed until EP is destroyed given the possibilty of consumer accessing CR
    private data buffer.

    cma: disconnect can block for excessive times waiting for rdma_cm DREP timeout
    
    rdma_cm uses the same timeout values for connect and disconnect
    request/reply. Disconnect abrupt option allows DAT consumers to
    specify a prompt disconnect with immediate event. If the remote
    node goes down or is non-responsive a CM disconnect event could
    take minutes. Add a time limit waiting for event and move EP to
    disconnected state to prevent callback from issuing duplicate
    disconnect event via callback. The EP to CM linking will
    cleanup/cancel any pending events before destroying cm_id.

    common: dat_evd_dequeue (poll_cq) fails  with invalid parameter after EP (qp) free
    
    Failure occured during Intel MPI spawn test on windows.
    The QP's need to be flushed and processed via EVD's during
    the EP (QP) destroy to avoid an error on poll_cq. IBAL
    provider was not moving to ERR state during QP destroy.
    
    Better flush CQ processing was added and pushed down to the provider
    level via dapls_ib_qp_free() where it can move QP to ERR, flush CQ,
    and then free QP after flushing. Because there is no QP_ERR_FLUSH
    state on a QP the spin on poll_cq (until empty) after modify_qp
    to ERR could return empty and before all WQE's are flushed. This
    could result in a CQE being added to CQ with a invalid QP reference.
    So, an additional check was added to flush_evds for the recv_q to
    poll_cq until all recv's pending are complete. For transmit_q there
    is no quarantee that the posted work is signaled and so the best
    that can be done is poll_cq until empty.

    ibal: delay QP transition during disconnect phase
    
    ibal provider calls ib_cm_drep in response to receiving
    a dreq.  The result is that the user's QP is transitioned
    through the error state, which fails any outstanding send
    operations and flushes all receives.  The disconnect request
    is then reported to the user.
    
    Since a user can receive errors from the QP before they are
    aware of a pending disconnect request, the application may
    respond to the errors as, well, actual errors.  Fix this by
    delaying the QP transition until the user responds to the
    dreq.

    dapl/cma: fix referencing freed address
    
    DAPL uses a pointer to reference the local and remote addresses
    of an endpoint.  It expects that those addresses are located
    in memory that is always accessible.  Typically, for the local
    address, the pointer references the address stored with the DAPL
    HCA device.  However, for the cma provider, it changes this pointer
    to reference the address stored with the rdma_cm_id.
    
    This causes a problem when that endpoint is connected on the
    passive side of a connection.  When connect requests are given
    to DAPL, a new rdma_cm_id is associated with the request.  The
    DAPL code replaces the current rdma_cm_id associated with a
    user's endpoint with the new rdma_cm_id.  The old rdma_cm_id is
    then deleted.  But the endpoint's local address pointer still
    references the address stored with the old rdma_cm_id.  The
    result is that any reference to the address will access freed
    memory.
    
    Fix this by keeping the local address pointer always pointing
    to the address associated with the DAPL HCA device.  This is about
    the best that can be done given the DAPL interface design.

    dapl_set_timer() creates a thread to process timers for dat_ep_connect
    but provides no mechanism to destroy/exit during dapl library unload.
    Timers are initialized in library init code and should be released

    scm, cma: dapli_thread doesn't always get teminated on library close.
    
    DAPL doesn't actually wait for the async processing thread to exit before
    allowing the library to close.  It will wait up to 10 seconds, which under
    heavy load isn't enough time.  Since the thread is created by an application
    level thread, it will continue to run as long as the application runs.  But
    if the application closes the library, then all library data and code is
    invalid, which can result in the thread running something that's not
    library code and accessing freed memory.
    
    With this change, I was able to run mpi ping-pong, 16 ranks on a single
    system (scm provider) without crashes 1300 times.

    cma: remove debug message after rdma_disconnect failure
    
    DAPL automatically calls rdma_disconnect() when a disconnect request is
    received.  If the user also calls disconnect, that calls rdma_disconnect() as
    well, but the connection has already been disconnected by DAPL and is no longer
    valid.  The result is that the user's call to rdma_disconnect() will fail.  Do
    not display an error message if this occurs.
    
    Locking could be added to prevent calling rdma_disconnect() multiple times, but
    since the librdmacm provides synchronization to trap this, we might as well take
    advantage of it.

    ucm: Add new provider using a DAPL based IB-UD cm mechanism for MPI implementations.
    
    New provider uses it's own CM protocol on top of IB-UD queue pairs.
    During device open, this provider creates a UD queue pair and
    returns local address information via dat_ia_query. This 24 byte
    opaque address must be exchange out-of-band before connecting to a
    server via dat_ep_connect. This provider is targeted for MPI
    implementations that already exchange address information
    during mpi_init phase.
    
    Future release may provide some ARP mechanism via multicast.
    
    dtest, dtestx, and dtestcm was modified to report the lid and qpn
    information on the server side so you can provide appropriate
    destination address information for the client test suite.
    
    dapltest will not work with this provider.

    CNO support broken in both CMA and SCM providers.
    
    CQ thread/callback mechanism was removed by mistake. Still
    need indirect DTO callbacks when CNO is attached to EVD's.
    
    Add CQ event channel to cma provider's thread and add
    to select for rdma_cm and async channels.
    
    For scm provider there is not easy way to add this channel
    to the select across sockets on windows. So, for portablity
    reasons 2 thread is started to process the ASYNC and
    CQ channels for events.
    
    Must disable EVD (evd_endabled=FALSE) during destroy
    to prevent EVD events firing for CNOs and re-arming CQ while
    CQ is being destroyed.
    
    Change dtest to check EVD after CNO timesout.

    DAPL introduced the concept of directly waiting on the CQ for
    events by adding a compile time flag and special handling in the common
    code.  Rather than using the compile time flag and modifying the
    common code, let the provider implement the best way to wait for
    CQ events.
    
    This simplifies the code and allows the common openib providers to
    optimize for Linux and Windows platforms independently, rather than
    assuming a specific implementation for signaling events.

    change byte vector allocation to stack in functions:
      DT_handle_send_op, DT_handle_rdma_op & DT_handle_recv_op.
    
    When allocation size is under the threshold, use a stack local
    allocation instead of malloc/free.  Move redundant bzero() to
    be called only in the case of using local stack allocation as
    DT_Mdep_malloc() already does a bzero(). Consolidate error handling

    openib_common: reorganize provider code base to share common mem, cq, qp, dto functions
    
    add new openib_common directory with cq, qp, util, dto, mem function calls
    and definitions. This basically leaves the unique CM and Device definitions
    and functions to the individual providers directory of openib_scm and openib_cma.
    
    modifications to dapl_cr_accept required. ep->cm_handle is allocated
    and managed entirely in provider so dapl common code should not update
    ep_handle->cm_handle from the cr->cm_handle automatically. The provider
    should determine which cm_handle is required for the accept.
    
    openib_cma defines _OPENIB_CMA_ and openib_scm defines _OPENIB_SCM_ for provider
    specific build needs in common code.

    Fix dapl_poll to return DAPL_FD_ERROR on

    Add new state for socket released, but CR
    not yet destroyed. This enables scm to release
    the socket resources immediately after exchanging
    all QP information. Also, add state to str call.
    
    Only add the CR reference to the EP if it is
    RC type. UD has multiple CR's per EP so when
    a UD EP disconnect_clean was called, from a
    timeout, it destroyed the wrong CR.

Author: Sean Hefty <sean.hefty@intel.com>
Date:   Thu Apr 16 10:21:26 2009 -0700

    Communication to the CR thread is done using an internal socket.  When a
    new connection request is ready for processing, an object is placed on
    the CR list, and data is written to the internal socket.  The write causes
    the CR thread to wake-up and process anything on its cr list.
    
    If multiple objects are placed on the CR list around the same time, then
    the CR thread will read in a single character, but process the entire list.
    This results in additional data being left on the internal socket.  When
    the CR does a select(), it will find more data to read, read the data, but
    not have any real work to do.  The result is that the thread spins in a
    loop checking for changes when none have occurred until all data on the
    internal socket has been read.
    
    Avoid this overhead by reading all data off the internal socket before
    processing the CR list.

    The dapl connect call takes as input an address (sockaddr) and a port number
    as separate input parameters.  It modifies the sockaddr address to set the
    port number before trying to connect.  This leads to a situation in
    dapltest with multiple threads that reference the same buffer for their
    address, but specify different port numbers, where the different threads
    end up trying to connect to the same remote port.
    
    To solve this, do not modify the caller's address buffer and instead use
    a local buffer.  This fixes an issue seen running multithreaded tests with
    dapltest.

    The connection request thread adds sockets to a select list unless
    the cr->socket is invalid and the cr request state is set to destroy.  If the
    cr->socket is invalid, but the cr->state is not destroy, then the cr->socket
    is added to an FD set for select/poll.  This results in select/poll
    returning an error when select is called.  As a result, the cr thread never
    actually blocks during this state.
    
    Fix this by only destroying a cr based on its state being set to destroy
    and skip adding cr->sockets to the FD set when they are invalid.

    The IBAL library allocates a small number of threads for callbacks to the
    user.  If the user blocks all of the callback threads, no additional
    callbacks can be invoked.  The DAPL IBAL provider cancels listen requests
    from within an IBAL callback, then waits for a second callback to confirm
    that the listen has been canceled.  If there is a single IBAL callback
    thread, or multiple listens are canceled simultaneously, then the provider
    can deadlock waiting for a cancel callback that never occurs.
    
    This problem is seen when running dapltest with multiple threads.

    dapltest: transaction test moves to cleanup stage before rdma_read processing is complete
    
    With multiple treads, the transaction server tread can move to cleanup
    stage and unregister memory before the remote client process has
    completed the rdma read. In lieu of a rewrite to add sync messages
    at the end of transaction test phase, just add a delay before cleanup.

    dapl scm: fix ibv_destroy_cq busy error condition during dat_evd_free.
    
    Problem surfaced while running Intel MPI 3.1 and mpich2-test suite.
    dapli_destroy_cm was incorrectly removing reference to qp_handle in endpoint
    and destroy_cq and destroy_pd code was ignoring verbs errors.

    dapl scm: Adding socket cm provider for better scalability on large homogeneous clusters.
    
    Bring socket cm provider back to life with some changes:
    
    better threading support for exchanging QP information.
    Avoid blocking during connect to support dynamic connection
    model with MPI implementations.
    
    consumer control of ack timeout/retries.
    
    disconnect/reject capabilities via socket exchange.
    
    version support for wire protocol to insure compatibility
    with peer scm provider. Add gids to exchange.
    
    validated with Intel MPI on a 14,000+ core fabric using IB DDR.

    dapl: endpoint pending request count is wrong
    
    The code assumes every cookie allocated during posting of
    requests gets completed. This incorrect assumption results in
    wrong pending count. Remove request_pending field and replace
    with direct call, dapl_cb_pending, to provide accurate
    data to consumer.
    
    Add debug print if consumer overruns request queue.

    dapl extension: dapli_post_ext should always allocate cookie for requests.
    
    extension didn't allocate cookie if completion was suppressed which resulted
    segfault during provider post call. Provider's expect cookie for wr_id,
    even with surpressed completions, to handle events during errors.

    dapl: Fix long delays with the cma provider open call when DNS is not configure on server.
    
    Open call should default to netdev names when resolving local IP address for cma binding to match dat.conf settings. The open code attempts to resolve with IP or Hostname first and if there is no DNS services setup the failover to netdev name resolution is delayed for as much as 20 seconds.

    The OFA dapl provider is checking for incorrect return code
    from rdma_bind_addr and rdma_listen calls. This causes an error
    to be returned back to the consumer instead of correctly
    incrementing the seed port and re-calling the OFA provider
    until a valid port is issued. The seed value (1000) is also
    incorrect and should start a non-privledged port (1024) to
    avoid EPERM errors when seeding the starting port value.

     Fix dtest to build properly with extensions.
    
     Modify dat.h dat_event to include event_extension_data[8].
     Extend struct dat_event outside of extension build
     switch to enable non-extended applications to work
     with extended libraries. Otherwise, there is a potential
     for the event callee to write back too much event data
     and exceed callers non-extended event buffer.

        Use inet_ntoa instead of open coding it. IP addresses were being
        reversed on PowerPC.
    
        On PowerPC the timebase ticks at a different frequency to the CPU.
        dapltest currently assumes a 1:1 relationship, and gives bogus values
        when scaling timebase to real time.
    
        To fix this, look at the timebase field in /proc/cpuinfo instead. To
        keep things consistent with x86, scale that value to MHz.

    Use inet_ntoa instead of open coding it. IP addresses were being
    reversed on PowerPC.
    
    On PowerPC the timebase ticks at a different frequency to the CPU.
    dapltest currently assumes a 1:1 relationship, and gives bogus values
    when scaling timebase to real time.
    
    To fix this, look at the timebase field in /proc/cpuinfo instead. To
    keep things consistent with x86, scale that value to MHz.

    r10074: Added support for new ib verbs client register event. No extra processing required at the uDAPL
    level.
    
    Fix some issues supporting create qp without recv cq handle or recv qp resources. IB verbs assume a
    recv_cq handle and uDAPL dapl_ep_create assumes there is always recv_sge resources specified.
    
    Fix some timeout and long disconnect delay issues discovered during scale-out testing. Added support
    to retry rdma_cm address and route resolution with configuration options. Provide a disconnect call
    when receiving the disconnect request to guarantee a disconnect reply and event on the remote side.
    The rdma_disconnect was not being called from dat_ep_disconnect() as a result of the state changing
    to DISCONNECTED in the event callback.
    
    Here are the new options (environment variables) with the default setting:
    
    DAPL_CM_ARP_TIMEOUT_MS   4000
    DAPL_CM_ARP_RETRY_COUNT  15
    DAPL_CM_ROUTE_TIMEOUT_MS  4000

    r3143: - Add user specified context to all uCM events.  Users will not retrieve
      any events associated with the context after destroying the corresponding
      cm_id.

    - Performs some minor code cleanup.
    - Replaces the ucm_simple test program with a userspace version of cmpost.
    - Updates DAPL to the new API.

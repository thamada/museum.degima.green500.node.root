Orca v2.28.3

Introduction
========================================================================

Orca is a free, open source, flexible, and extensible screen reader
that provides access to the graphical desktop via user-customizable
combinations of speech, braille, and/or magnification.  Under
development by the Sun Microsystems, Inc., Accessibility Program
Office since 2004, Orca has been created with early input from and
continued engagement with its end users.

Orca works with applications and toolkits that support the assistive
technology service provider interface (AT-SPI), which is the primary
assistive technology infrastructure for the Solaris and Linux
operating environments.  Applications and toolkits supporting the
AT-SPI include the GNOME GTK+ toolkit, the Java platform's Swing
toolkit, OpenOffice, and Mozilla.  AT-SPI support for the KDE Qt
toolkit is currently being pursued.

See also http://live.gnome.org/Orca for detailed English and Spanish
information on Orca, including how to run Orca, how to communicate
with the Orca user community, and where to log bugs and feature
requests.

The Orca manual can be found in the GNOME Desktop Accessibility Guide:

Build Requirements
========================================================================

Orca v2.28.x is supported on GNOME 2.28.x only.  We highly suggest you
use the latest releases of GNOME because they contain accessibility
infrastructure and application bug fixes that help Orca work better.

Building Orca also requires the development modules for the following
to be installed:

* Python           - Python platform
* pyorbit          - Python bindings for ORBit2
* pygtk            - GTK+ Python bindings
* gnome-python     - Python bindings for various GNOME libraries
* gnome-speech-1.0 - Python bindings for gnome-speech
* gnome-mag-1.0    - Python bindings for gnome-mag (optional) 
* BrlTTY           - BrlTTY support for braille (optional)
* BrlAPI           - BrlAPI support for braille (optional)

YOU ALSO NEED THE LATEST AT-SPI AND ATK FOR THE GNOME 2.28.x
DEVELOPMENT RELEASES.  THEY MAY CONTAIN VERY IMPORTANT BUG FIXES!

NOTE: If you have multiple versions of the python interpreter installed
on your machine, you should set the PYTHON environment variable when 
configuring Orca.  For example:

   PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.4 ./autogen.sh

or

   PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.4 ./configure

NOTE FOR BRLTTY USERS:
========================================================================

Orca depends upon the Python bindings for BrlAPI available in BrlTTY v3.8
or better.  You can determine if the Python bindings for BrlAPI are
installed by running the following command:

python -c "import brlapi"

If you get the following error, the Python bindings for BrlAPI are not
installed.  This is most likely because whoever built BrlTTY did not
have Pyrex installed before building BrlTTY:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named brlapi

If you run into this, install python-pyrex and rebuild/reinstall BrlTTY.

See also http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Braille for more information on
BrlTTY and also using liblouis for contracted braille.

Running Orca
========================================================================

To run Orca, you have several options:

1) Enable accessibility and the screen reader via the
   "System->Preferences->Assistive Technology Preferences"
   dialog box (also available as the 'gnome-at-properties'
   application).  As of GNOME 2.16, this will cause Orca to
   be automatically launched when you log in.

2) Add Orca as a startup application in the
   "Systems->Preferences->Sessions" dialog box (also available as
   the 'gnome-session-properties' application).  This will cause Orca
   to be launched automatically when you log in.

3) Select "Orca Screen Reader and Magnifier" from the 
   Applications->Accessibility launch menu (also available as
   the 'orca' application).  This will run Orca once.

4) Press Alt+F2 to bring up the "Run Application" dialog
   box.  Enter "orca" and press Return.  This will run
   Orca once.

5) Run the "orca" command from a virtual console or 
   gnome-terminal window.  This will run Orca once.

When you run Orca for the first time, you will be prompted for your
initial user preferences.  The first time you run Orca, you also need
to log out and log back in in order for accessibility to be enabled in
your environment.  If you wish to modify your Orca preferences in the
future, you can press "Insert+space" while Orca is running, or you can
re-run orca with the "--setup" command line option.

You can bypass the Orca setup utility by running orca with the
"--no-setup" option.  This is useful for running from environments
such as the login screen.

In general, you should not have to use any Orca-specific keystrokes;
Orca will follow your focus as you navigate the screen using the
built-in keyboard navigation mechanisms of the GNOME desktop.  For
more information on accessing the desktop, including the built-in
keyboard shortcuts of the GNOME desktop, see the GNOME Desktop
Accessibility Guide:

http://www.gnome.org/learn/access-guide/latest/

If you find you run into an ill-behaved application, or you just want
to explore an application using Orca's flat review mode, you can use
the numeric keypad.  A quick overview of the keypad is as follows:

Keypad 7, 8, 9:  review previous, current, and next line of window
Keypad 4, 5, 6:  review previous, current, and next word
Keypad 1, 2, 3:  review previous, current, and next character
Keypad Enter:    provide "where am I?" information
Keypad +:        read the current text document

Other Orca keyboard commands include:

Insert+space:       bring up the configuration GUI
Insert+s:           turn speech on and off
Insert+left_arrow:  slow speech down
Insert+right_arrow: speed speech up
Insert+up_arrow:    increase speech pitch
Insert+down_arrow:  decrease speech pitch
Insert+f:           read the text attributes at the caret position
Insert+q:           quit Orca

Furthermore, to get help while running Orca, press "Insert+F1".  This
will enable "learn mode", which provides a spoken and brailled
description of what various keyboard and braille input device actions
will do.  To exit learn mode, press "Escape."  Finally, the
preferences dialog contains a "Key Bindings" tab that lists the
keyboard binding for Orca.

To quit Orca, you can press "Insert+q" as shown above, or run 
"orca --quit" from the command line.

Scripting Orca
========================================================================

So, you want to write a script for Orca?  The best thing to do is 
start by looking at other scripts under the src/orca/scripts/ hierarchy
of the source tree.  Also, the docs/doc-set/internals.html file contains
detailed information about the internal workings of Orca.

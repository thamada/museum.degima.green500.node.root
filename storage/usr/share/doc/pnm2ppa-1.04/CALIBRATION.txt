  There are three main tasks you may need to carry out to fine-tune your
  PPA printer:

  +o  Adjust the x-offset and y-offset to ccoorrrreeccttllyy cceenntteerr tthhee pprriinntteedd
     ppaaggee oonn tthhee ppaappeerr

  +o  Adjust the relative offsets between black and colored ink printing
     - tthhiiss sshhoouulldd bbee ddoonnee eeaacchh ttiimmee yyoouu rreeppllaaccee aann iinnkk ccaarrttrriiddggee.

  +o  Match the colors of printed images to some other output device -
     this is ccoolloorr ccoorrrreeccttiioonn and is described in COLOR.html (or
     COLOR.txt).

  These instructions assume that you are already able to print
  postscript files with your PPA printer.   If your print filters are
  properly configured, something like "lpr test.ps" will successfully
  invoke ghostscript and pnm2ppa to print the postscript file test.ps.
  Alternatively, you may be using shell scripts like "lprbw", "lprcolor"
  and "lpreco" supplied with the pnm2ppa source code, and modified by
  you for your defaults; you may also have defined special printing
  devices in /etc/printcap, e.g.  a "coloreco" device so you print with
  lpr -P coloreco  test.ps.    These details vary with the operating
  system and distribution you use.

  This is done by adjusting the x-offset and y-offset parameters xxooffffsseett
  and yyooffffsseett in the pnm2ppa configuration file (usually
  /etc/pnm2ppa.conf).   The parameters are given in units of 1/600 inch;
  increasing xoffset  moves the image to the right, and increasing
  yoffset moves it downwards.  These offsets now have default values
  defined for each printer model, and you will probably not need to
  adjust them.  Uncomment and make small adjustments to the default
  values for these in the configuration file, until the printout is
  satisfactory.  (You can also  use the '-x' and '-y' command-line
  parameters.)


  There are two ways to check the offsets.

  +o  either uussiinngg tthhee ""calibrate_ppa" program.

  +o  or   pprriinnttiinngg aa ssuuiittaabbllee tteesstt ppaaggee.


  The "calibrate_ppa" program  is a stand-alone program distributed with
  pnm2ppa which creates various test patterns in the raw pixmap  format
  accepted by pnm2ppa. (The three paper sizes, US Letter,  US Legal, and
  A4, are supported).  If your paper size is A4, and your printer filter
  accepts the "-l" (direct output) option to lpr, the command to run is:


        calibrate_ppa -s a4  --center  | pnm2ppa --bw  -i -  -o - | lpr -l


  (Substitute "letter"  or "legal" for "a4" to change the papersize; if
  no paper size is specified, it is assumed to be letter.)



  If "lpr -l" is not valid, you need to know  which port your printer is
  attached to.   Assuming it is /dev/lp0, the above command becomes
   calibrate_ppa  -s a4 --center | pnm2ppa --bw  -i -  -o  /dev/lp0.


  The pattern shows  distances from the edge of the printed page in
  units of 50 dots (1/12 inch), and diagonal lines that should point to
  the corners.  Change xoffset and yoffset in the configuration file
  (usually /etc/pnm2ppa.conf to center the pattern.    The configuration
  file is supplied with commented-out entries like #xoffset 160 showing
  the default value.  Remove the "#" to activate the entry.

  In Red Hat or Mandrake Linux distributions, a suitable test  page is
  /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/testpage.ps (US Letter paper) or
  /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/testpage-a4.ps (A4 paper).   (If these
  are not available, similar test pages are supplied in the pnm2ppa
  source  distribution.)  These pages have margins drawn at standard
  distances from the edges of the paper, and can also be used to check
  the centering, but are not as accurate

  The color ink offsets now have to be calibrated with respect to the
  black ink.  Because the relative position of the two ink cartridges
  can move slightly, tthhiiss mmuusstt bbee ddoonnee wwhheenneevveerr aann iinnkk ccaarrttrriiddggee iiss

  To print an alignment calibration pattern on a4 paper, run


       calibrate_ppa -s a4  --align | pnm2ppa --fd  -i - -o - | lpr -l




  On the printed page, there are four  alignment patterns, corresponding
  to configuration file parameters  CCoollOOffffssXX, CCoollOOffffssYY, ccoolloorrsshheeaarr and
  bbllaacckksshheeaarr.   The central alignment patterns, labelled "0" should be
  perfectly aligned.   If they are not, first correct the shearing
  patterns, (see below).  Then identify the best-aligned  CCoollOOffffssXX and
  CCoollOOffffssYY patterns, and  add or subtract the positive or negative
  number below the pattern from the value in the configuration file.

  Check the result  by printing the alignment test pattern:


       calibrate_ppa  --test | pnm2ppa -fd  -i - -o - | lpr -l




  The lines in the cross and square should be perfectly straight now.

  The calibration can also be done by printing the test page test.ps
  (found in the tarball pnm2ppa-1.0.tar.gz; or installed with the
  pnm2ppa documentation. (This is often in /usr/doc/pnm2ppa*/.)


  On the printout you see several images:

  +o  top left, you see a square with both black and colored items.
     These should align correctly, or you have to change your settings.

  +o  You see a large vertical bar, and also a horizontal bar.  On the
     sides of the vertical  bar there are a blue and a green line.
     These should align with the 0 mark.

  +o  You also see a small vertical, and horizontal, bar, with a red bar
     on its side.

  If these items do NOT line up, you should take the following steps:

  +o  (1) take for the large bar the number of the tickmark just smaller
     than the place where the green and blue lines point to. The minor
     tick marks are 25 points.

  +o  (2) To this number, add the number of the tick mark at which a red
     tick mark exactly lines up. This might not work if the offsets are
     way off; in that case, apply the correction of step 1, and print
     again.

  +o  (3) Add the horizontal offset to the value of CCoollOOffffssXX, and the
     vertical offset to the value of CCoollOOffffssYY in the configuration file.

  Now you can print test.ps again to see whether this procedure worked.


  SShheeaarriinngg  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss

  If bidirectional printing causes "shearing" of vertical lines
  (horizontal offsets of those parts of the line printed by left-to-
  right print-head sweeps relative to those printed on right-to-left
  sweeps) you can make small adjustments (in 1/600 inch) units using the
  bbllaacckksshheeaarr and ccoolloorrsshheeaarr parameters in the configuration file.  You
  can also suppress bidirectional printing with a  uunniimmooddee  11
  configuration file entry.

  The third and fourth lines on the color head offset calibration page
  (see above) correspond to color and black print head  shearing
  corrections.  If the central alignment patterns  (labeled "0") are not
  aligned,  add  or subtract the  positive or negative number below the
  best-aligned pattern from the colorshear and blackshear values in the
  configuration file.

  CClleeaanniinngg tthhee PPrriinntt HHeeaaddss

  You can use calibrate_ppa to clean the print heads by printing
  patterns that exercise  all the ink nozzles:


       calibrate_ppa  --clean | pnm2ppa -p   -i - -o - | lpr -l
       calibrate_ppa  --clean | pnm2ppa --bw  -i - -o - | lpr -l




  The first of these commands prints a cleaning pattern with colored
  ink, the second uses black ink.


  OOtthheerr  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss

  The parameter bbllaacckknneessss adjusts the number of black ink drops printed
  per pixel.  It takes values 1, 2, 3, or 4 (2 is the default).  Other
  values, like 0, suppress black ink.

  Inks can also be suppressed by configuration file entries black_ink 0,
  color_ink 0, cyan_ink 0, magenta_ink 0, or yellow_ink 0.  These  are
  mainly useful for debugging the printer driver.

What is this?
-------------
This software creates output using the PPA (printer performance
architecture) protocol.  This protocol is used by some HP "Windows-only"
printers, including the HP Deskjet 820C series, the HP DeskJet 720 series,
and the HP DeskJet 1000 series.  It has been tested on all three printers,
but your personal experience (positive or negative) is very much appreciated!

----------
	Read the INSTALL file to compile and install this software.

Bugs / Quirks
-------------
	I only support black-and-white printing right now.  Color support
to come when I find the time.  (Contributors welcome!)

        The default offsets and margins may cause a 'blinking lights syndrome'
for some printers (where all three lights blink rapidly).  If this is the
case for your printer, widen the margins dramatically using command-line
parameters and then follow the procedure described in the CALIBRATION file.
Once calibrated, margins of 1/4 inch should succeed.

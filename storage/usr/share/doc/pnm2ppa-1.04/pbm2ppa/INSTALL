Overview
--------
	This file contains some quick notes on installation in general.  For a
complete step-by-step instruction on how to install pbm2ppa for your
printer, please see INSTALL-MORE.  (It was written for the 820, but it
should work for all supported models) Thanks to Michael Buehlmann for
writing that guide!

Compilation
-----------
	To compile, you should simply run 'make' with the series of your
printer. This will set the default printer to the HP720 series.
To specify a different default printyer, the following options are supported:

make 720	# for 720 series - e.g. 722C
make 820	# for 820 series - e.g. 820Cse
make 1000	# for 1000 series

	If you choose to recompile for a different default  printer series, 
you must 'make clean' first.  However, the default printer choice
selected at compilation time can be overridden with e.g., the 
"pbm2pppa -v  820 ..."	command line option, or specified by e.g., 
a "version 820" entry in the /etc/pbm2ppa.conf file.
Type "pbm2ppa -h" to see the list of options.

Installation
------------
	Two binaries are created: pbmtpg and pbm2ppa.  pbmtpg is used to
calibrate your printer (the default calibrations should work okay,
but you might want to tweak them).  See the CALIBRATION file for details.

	The other binary created, pbm2ppa, is a converter from a PBM
image to a stream of PPA data that can be sent directly to the printer.
The PBM image is expected to be 600 dpi, and the paper size
can be   8.5"x11" (US Letter), 8.5"x14" (US Legal) or A4.  These files can be
generated with ghostscript.  Both the pbm and pbmraw devices are supported.
pbmraw is MUCH faster, so use it if you have it available!
IMPORTANT: the PAPERSIZE option passed to ghostscript must match
the paper size specified for pbm2ppa.
Valid papersizes are: "letter" = "us" , "legal" , and "a4" .

Use
---
	To print a postscript file with this program, on US Letter
paper and a HP 710/720 series printer, I use a simple shell script:

cat $1 | gs -sDEVICE=pbm -q -dNOPAUSE -r600  -sPAPERSIZE=letter -sOutputFile=- - | \
pbm2ppa -s letter -v 720 - - | lpr -l 

Valid printer versions are "720", "820" and "1000".

	You can also set up a printer filter.  See the documentation for
your print spooler for information on how to do that, or look in
hp820install.doc for an example lpd print filter for Postscript and text
files.

			MPI Selector 1.0 release notes
				December 2009
			==============================

OFED contains a simple mechanism for system administrators and end
users to select which MPI implementation they want to use.  The MPI
selector functionality is not specific to any MPI implementation; it
can be used with any implementation that provides shell startup files
that correctly set the environment for that MPI.  The OFED installer
will automatically add MPI selector support for each MPI that it
installs.  Additional MPI's not known by the OFED installer can be
listed in the MPI selector; see the mpi-selector(1) man page for
details.

Note that MPI selector only affects the default MPI environment for
*future* shells.  Specifically, if you use MPI selector to select MPI
implementation ABC, this default selection will not take effect until
you start a new shell (e.g., logout and login again).  Other packages
(such as environment modules) provide functionality that allows
changing your environment to point to a new MPI implementation in the
current shell.  The MPI selector was not meant to duplicate or replace
that functionality.

The MPI selector functionality can be invoked in one of two ways:

1. The mpi-selector-menu command.

    This command is a simple, menu-based program that allows the
    selection of the system-wide MPI (usually only settable by root)
    and a per-user MPI selection.  It also shows what the current
    selections are.

    This command is recommended for all users.

2. The mpi-selector command.

    This command is a CLI-equivalent of the mpi-selector-menu,
    allowing for the same functionality as mpi-selector-menu but
    without the interactive menus and prompts.  It is suitable for
    scripting.

See the mpi-selector(1) man page for more information.

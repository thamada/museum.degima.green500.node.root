Summary
    qperf - Measure RDMA and IP performance

Overview
    qperf measures bandwidth and latency between two nodes.  It can work over
    TCP/IP as well as the RDMA transports.

Quick Start
    * Since qperf measures latency and bandwidth between two nodes, you need
      access to two nodes.  Assume they are called node1 and node2.

    * On node1, run qperf without any arguments.  It will act as a server and
      continue to run until asked to quit.

    * To measure TCP bandwidth between the two nodes, on node2, type:
        qperf node1 tcp_bw

    * To measure RDMA RC latency, type (on node2):
        qperf node1 rc_lat

    * To measure RDMA UD latency using polling, type (on node2):
        qperf node1 -P 1 ud_lat

    * To measure SDP bandwidth, on node2, type:
        qperf node1 sdp_bw

Documentation
    * Man page available.  Type
        man qperf

    * To get a list of examples, type:
        qperf --help examples

    * To get a list of tests, type:
        qperf --help tests

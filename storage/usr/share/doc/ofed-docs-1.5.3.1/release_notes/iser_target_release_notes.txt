              STGT/iSER target in OFED 1.5 Release Notes

			   December 2009


* Background

	iSER allows iSCSI to be layered over RDMA transports (including InfiniBand
	and iWARP (RNIC)). Linux target framework (tgt) aims to simplify various SCSI
	target driver (iSCSI, Fibre Channel, SRP, etc) creation and maintenance.

	tgt supports the following target drivers (among othets)

	- iSCSI software (tcp) target driver for Ethernet/IPoIB NICs
	- iSER software target driver for Infiniband and RDMA NICs

	For iSCSI and iSER tgt consists of user-space daemon, and user-space
	tools. That is, no special kernel support is needed other than the
	kernel (and user space) RDMA stacks.

	The code is under the GNU General Public License version 2.

	This package is based on a snapshot (clone) of the tgt git tree taken
	on August 28th, 2008

===============================================================================
7. Known Issues
===============================================================================
The following is a list of general limitations and known issues of the various
components of the OFED 1.5.3 release.

1. When upgrading from an earlier OFED version, the installation script does
   not stop the earlier OFED version prior to uninstalling it. 
   Workaround: Stop the old OFED stack (/etc/init.d/openibd stop) before 
   upgrading to OFED 1.5.3 or reboot the server after OFED installation.
2. Memory registration by the user is limited according to administrator
   setting. See "Pinning (Locking) User Memory Pages" in OFED_tips.txt for
   system configuration.
3. Fork support from kernel 2.6.12 and above is available provided
   that applications do not use threads. fork() is supported as long as the
   parent process does not run before the child exits or calls exec().
   The former can be achieved by calling wait(childpid), and the latter can be
   achieved by application specific means.  The Posix system() call is
   supported.
4. The qib driver is supported only on 64-bit platforms.
5. When installing OFED on OpenSuse or Ubuntu, use the --without-depcheck
   option of the install.pl script.
6. IPoIB: brctl utilities do not work on IPoIB interfaces. The reason for that
   is that these utilities support devices of type Ethernet only.
7.  "openibd stop" can sometime fail with the error: 
        Unloading ib_cm                                            [FAILED]
        ERROR: Module ib_cm is in use by ib_ipoib 
    Workaround: run "openibd stop" again or remove ib_ipoib aliases from 
                /etc/modprobe.d/ib_ipoib.conf.
8. When working with ISCSI over IPoIB or mlx4_en, you must disable LRO (even
   if IPoIB is set to connected mode). This is due to a bug in older kernels
   which causes a kernel panic.
9. On SLES11, and in case uninstall is failing, check the error log and remove
   the remaining RPMs manually using 'rpm -e <rpms list>'.
10. On SLES11, set allow_unsupported_modules parameter to 1 in file:
    /etc/modprobe.d/unsupported-modules. Without this the modules will not
    load.
11. iSER is supported on kernel.org 2.6.30, 2.6.31 and 2.6.32 only.
    OFED-1.5.3 will not install iSER on other kernels, and the original iSER
    module that comes with the Linux distribution will stop working due to a
    mismatch in the symbols version.
12. On SLES10 SP3, the kernel 2.6.16.60-0.54.5 should be updated to
    2.6.16.60-0.59.1 or later. The original kernel may cause kernel panic
    during '/etc/init.d/openibd restart'.
13. ConnectX/ConnectX2 in VPI mode are not supported in PPC64

Note: See the release notes of each component for additional issues.

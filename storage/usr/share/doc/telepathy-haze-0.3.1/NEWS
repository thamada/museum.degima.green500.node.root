telepathy-haze 0.3.1 (2009-06-05)
=================================

The “man3 encounters player, who quotes Hayek” release.

Enhancements:

 * Shaved `make` output, courtesy of Jonny Lamb. This is disabled by
   default; ./configure --enable-shave to enable it.

 * haze.manager has been updated for more recent libpurples. Fixes
   fd.o#17709.

Fixes:

 * Connection.GetInterfaces() now includes Requests. Fixes fd.o#21800.

telepathy-haze 0.3.0 (2009-04-04)
=================================

The “Google Abandonware” release.

Dependencies:

 * telepathy-glib >= 0.7.21 is now required.

Enhancements:

 * Connections implement the Requests, SimplePresence and Contacts
   interfaces, courtesy of Simon McVittie.
 * Text channels implement the Messages and Destroyable interfaces.
 * Courtesy of Simon McVittie, telepathy-gabble and FinnAir flight 0837,
   Haze now has a test suite! They test Haze connecting to a fake XMPP
   server; while not perfect (no-one should use Haze for XMPP in real
   life!) it's an improvement on no tests.

Fixes:

 * Text channels closed with pending messages now respawn. (Fixes
   fd.o#17842.)
 * Compiles without warnings on AMD64, courtesy of Larry Reaves. (Fixes
   fd.o#18513.)
 * No longer asserts if you try to set the alias for someone not on your
   contact list. Empathy turns out to do this if you try to accept an
   authorization request. (Fixes fd.o#17382.)
 * Doesn't crash if you try to open a second connection to the same
   account. (Fixes fd.o#18361.)

telepathy-haze 0.2.1 (2008-08-18)
=================================

The “DUM DE DUM DE DIDDLE IDDLE DE DUM‼” release.

Dependencies:

 * Haze now requires telepathy-glib >= 0.7.0.

Fixes and Enhancements:

 * A publish channel now exists, which allows you to accept or decline
   incoming subscription requests (but nothing else yet; it's not
   possible to later remove someone from the list, for instance).
 * Add support for setting your avatar (fd.o #13123).
 * Stop your accounts auto-awaying themselves (fd.o #14335).
 * Don't crash when the UI passes an empty or otherwise invalid host
   name as the server parameter for a new connection (fd.o #14445).
 * Don't sporadically crash on connection errors, such as an incorrect
   password (fd.o #14933).
 * Debugging output from Haze and libpurple is now silenced unless you
   set HAZE_DEBUG appropriately ("haze" and "purple", respectively).

telepathy-haze 0.2.0 (2008-02-07)
=================================

The "I Remember Piano Lessons" release.

Fixes:

 * Protocols now present the correct parameters, with appropriate
   defaults, rather than always taking account, password and server.
 * Send apostrophes correctly on Yahoo! Messenger.

telepathy-haze 0.1.4 (2007-11-21)
=================================

The “Watch That Pinkie” release.

Fixes:

 * Fix building against glib 2.10 (which is the lowest version against
   which telepathy-glib builds).
 * Fix building against libpurple when built without D-Bus support, and
   suppress libpurple's own D-Bus messages on libpurple <= 2.1.0 (they
   were already suppressed on later libpurples).

telepathy-haze 0.1.3 (2007-11-14)
=================================

The “Fix the Sky a Little” release.

Fixes and Enhancements:

 * Don't mistakenly delete ~/.purple on exit with libpurple >= 2.3.0
 * Build without warnings against telepathy-glib 0.6.1.
 * Disable -Werror in releases.
 * Report message send errors.
 * Report reasons for disconnecting properly (requires libpurple >=
   2.3.0)

telepathy-haze 0.1.2 (2007-09-16)
=================================

The “Re: Your Brains” release.

Fixes:

 * Properly clean up zombie children.  No more mountains of defunct
   telepathy-haze processes!
 * Fix sending messages with <, > and &.  (Previously, "i <3 u" was sent
   as "i ", which is much less romantic.)
 * Use "local-xmpp" rather than "bonjour" as the name of the protocol
   formerly known as Rendezvous.

telepathy-haze 0.1.1 (2007-08-17)
=================================

The “Release less often, release correctly” release.

Fixes:

 * Fixed some segfaults, and some corruption caused by g_free-ing
   slice-allocated memory.

telepathy-haze 0.1.0 (2007-08-10)
=================================

The “It's Like The ... 90s” release.

Supported in this release:

 * Connecting to MSN, XMPP, AIM known to work.
 * Plain text conversations with individual contacts.
 * The 'subscribe' list, plus contact list groups.
 * Basic presence: available, busy, away, extended away, invisible, with
   a message when supported by the underlying prpl.

   saving custom aliases for your contacts to the server (where
   supported by the prpl).

0.3001  2007-08-30

- No longer including RFCs in the tarball, per the request of the
  Debian maintainer for this package. Apparently, this makes their job
  harder, and it serves no useful purpose for me. Requested by Gunnar
  Wolf. RT #28480.


0.30    2006-07-24

- The strict parsing made the day name mandatory, even though RFC822
  and 2822 specify it as optional. Reported by Julian Mehnle. See RT
  20451.

- Turned off signing, since it seems to be causing more trouble than
  it's worth.

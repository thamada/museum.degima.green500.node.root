What's new in  GOK 1.0.6?

       Enhanced EWMH behavior - GOK registers itself as a pager now.
       Works better with Firefox toolbars.
       Works better with OpenOffice configuration dialogs and menus.
       Bugfixes for: #321908, #323975, #160848, #322062, #308417,
		#304524, OpenOffice Issuezilla #48639.

       'fa' (Persian/Farsi - Roozbeh Pournader)
       'gl' (Galician - Ignacio Casal Quinteiro)

What's new in  GOK 1.0.5?

       * Respond to more children-changed:add events, specifically, rebuild
         the UI component list if children are added to ROLE_FRAME objects,
         ROLE_ROOT_PANE objects, or ROLE_PANEL objects (in addition to the
         roles already listened to, for instance ROLE_HTML_CONTAINER).

       * Handle the somewhat aberrant menus that some gtk+ apps exhibit if
         their UIs were created with glade - namely, menus may have
         ROLE_MENU_ITEM instead of ROLE_MENU.  If a ROLE_MENU_ITEM has
         children, then we now treat it as though it had ROLE_MENU.

What's new in  GOK 1.0.4?

       * Fix for #301377, we can now handle actionable table cells even if
         they don't have unique names.
	 
       * We now grab focus if the actionable item is a button; 
         this improves behavior with the gtk file selector.

       * New languages:  "eu" (Basque),  IÃ±aki LarraÃ±aga.
                         "rw" (Rwandan), Steve Murphy.

What's new in GOK 1.0.1?

* Fix for #168093 GOK now implements some libwnck API locally to avoid
   build compatibility issues with newly changed libwnck API.

* Fix for #168281 Memory allocation issues fixed.

* Fix for #168405 Fixed unwanted activation in dwell mode when the core pointer
   happens to enter a GOK window without purposeful user action.

What's new in GOK 1.0.0?

* With version 1.0.0 GOK has reached production quality release. This version
   is very similar to 0.12.4.  We have updated the README file and made sure
   all the appropriate files have been marked for translation.

What's new in GOK 0.12.4?

* Fix for rfe #166552 - GOK now autodetects XInput events from unexpected 
  devices, and allows user to select the new XInput device.  GOK also
  attempts to work around corepointer conflicts by swapping the corepointer
  while it's running and restoring it on exit.
  This gives a great deal more insurance against core-pointer conflicts,
  USB-mouse renumbering due to hot-swapping, and other HID configuration
  issues.

* Bugfix for #166779 - we've fixed the regression in 'Mouse' functions.

* Bugfix for #159163 (Harry Lu) - we now successfully find more table-cell
  children, because we search recursively for names.

What's new in GOK 0.12.3?

* Four new translatable strings, for warning dialogs and alerts.

* Fixes for bugs #151606, #149266, #165828, #134348.

* New help manual from Irene Ryan.

What's new in GOK 0.12.0?

* bug fixes and a sparse NEWS section.

* Changed some terminology in UI to be consistent, i.e.
  "Select" and "Activate" mean pretty much the same thing across
  access methods now, 'select' means highlight, 'activate' means
  "virtual-click the GOK button".

What's new in GOK 0.11.16?

* Emergency bugfix for #157420 in 0.11.15.

* Bug fixes including: 155556, 157138, 157221, 154961, 155805, 156802
  154918, 156802,   
 
* Mostly fixes and improvements to the dynamic accessibility keyboards.


What's new in GOK 0.11.14 ?

* Bug fixes including: 155182 (double actions), 154499,
  154604, #156153, #156479, 155344, 155473, 155476, 155512.
           
* LoginHelper's setSafe implementation now prevents
  word completion, as it should.

* Distinguish between HTML content and browser controls.

* Hush compiler warnings (bug 154915).        

What's new in GOK 0.11.10/0.11.11 ?

* Fix regression caused by bugfix 151417; this release
  should be used instead of 0.11.9.

What's new in GOK 0.11.9 ?

  possible user action available.  Fixes bug #151417.

* Improved table and list behavior: Bugfixes for #153130, #152788,
  #153389.

* Rewrite of online help (thanks to Irene Ryan!)

What's new in GOK 0.11.8 ?

* Fixed broken .m4 macro (bugzilla 152086)

What's new in GOK 0.11.7 ?

* Account for BORDERPIX in DOCK windows, which 
  prevents some resize problems with the 'Show' and 'Hide' keys.
  (#149842).

* Don't dist the merged .kbd files, they are regenerated on make.
  (If this breaks anyone's rpm maker, we may reconsider this change)

What's new in GOK 0.11.6 ?

* Fixes for bug #144435, #147633, #142831, and #150260.
  Non-XKB compose keyboards are working better now with
  word completion, and at login with a working 'Menus' key.

* Don't do word completion if current text field is PASSWORD_TEXT.

* new language: id (Indonesian), Ahmad Riza H Nst.

What's new in GOK 0.11.4 ?

* Allows user to override access method, "scan" action, and "select"
  actions from command line.  See "gok --usage" or "gok --help" for
  more info.

* Requires at-spi-1.5.2 or better.

* Requires libloginhelper-1.0.

* Implements LoginHelper interface, to let authentication clients know
  that GOK needs certain services during screen lock or authentication
  (such as having its main window raised, access to XInput devices, etc.)

* Always register with bonobo-activation (as a LoginHelper).

* Fixed bug in gok_scanner_current_state_uses_corepointer, which
  means the "core pointer warning" dialog doesn't get posted
  unnecessarily.

* Adds a new gconf key, /apps/gok/per_user_dictionary, 
  which determines whether each GOK user has a private (writeable)
  copy of the main GOK word completion dictionary or not.

* Bug fixes: #143453, #143295, #142796.


=====

What's new in GOK 0.11.3 ?

* Warn user about likely side-effects when starting GOK in 
  corepointer mode (except for Direct
  Selection access method).

  prevent them from raising above GOK's main window when in DOCK mode.
  (#136160).

* Fixed the very broken KEYSTRING word completion input.

* Added a utility ('create_branching_keyboard') for creating
  branching compose keyboards for non-Latin locales and locales which
  normally require 'input methods' for text input.
 
* Allow user to chooise between prebuild compose keyboard from a
  custom .kbd file. a keyboard created from the XKB keyboard
  description on the X Server (default), an alphabetic keyboard, or a
  keyboard with alphabetic keys listed in order of frequency.  Better
  handling of key shift levels for non-alphabetic keys.

* Added a numberpad keyboard (136482) and put a branch key for it on
  the compose keyboard.

* Added a valuator keyboard, and support UI grab and manipulation of
  sliders and scrollbars (132757, 138751).

* Allow the user to change the sensitivity of the XInput valuators
  (132132).

* Allow the user to select Dock and Fill modes for GOK from the
  "Settings" dialog (118222).

* Allow the user to specify an additional search directory for GOK
  keyboards (109181, 140929)

* by default we put the additional keys on the "XKB" Compose keyboard
  on the leftmost column instead of on a new row, to conserve space.

* Use libglade instead of glade-generated source files.

* Require libbonobo-2 2.5.1

* Better support for tables, including the ability to select rows in
  GNOME tables via GOK.

* Build and packaging fixes.

* Fixes for bugs: 133545, 117568, 138683, 129450, 136065, 136732,
  139495, 140051, 141996, 136877, 141240, more.

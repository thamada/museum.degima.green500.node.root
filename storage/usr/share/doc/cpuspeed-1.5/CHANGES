Version 1.5
    Reworked multi-core CPU handling. Now automatically figures out which cores
    should be controlled as a single group vs. controlled individually

    Minor compiling, debugging and optimization changes

Version 1.2.1
    Can now better handle processors with a large number of speed steps (>20)

    Configurable maximum and minimum CPU speeds

    Option to maximize speed when AC adapter connected

    Option to NOT minimize speed when AC adapter disconnected

    Consider I/O wait time as idle time

    Option to restore previous speed on program exit

    Can set polling interval for CPU idle, AC adapter and temperature separately

    Better Red Hat / Fedora Core / SuSE script integration

    More efficient startup sequence (fewer speed changes necessary)

    Full multi-processor support

    Try to load default list of drivers if none specified

Version 1.1
    One binary works on both 2.4 and 2.5+ kernels

    Updated to work with latest sysfs directory structure (tested with 2.5.75)

    Now the program is even better at making sure tempermental Athlons don't
    crash no matter what state the CPU is in on startup

    Simplified things by having just one threshold level instead of two

    Replaced floating point math with integer

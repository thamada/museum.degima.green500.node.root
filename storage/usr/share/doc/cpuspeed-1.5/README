CPUSpeed v1.5

Carl Thompson <cet@carlthompson.net>

This program monitors the system's idle percentage and reduces or raises the
CPUs' clock speeds and voltages accordingly to minimize power consumption
when idle and maximize performance when needed.  This is the default.

The program may also optionally be configured to reduce the CPUs' clock
speeds if the temperature gets too high, NOT minimize their speeds if the
computer's AC adapter is disconnected or maximize their speeds when the AC
adapter is connected.

By default this program will manage every CPU found in the system.

This program is only for computers with Linux kernels compiled with CPUFreq.
You must have a CPU that supports frequency and / or voltage scaling via
CPUFreq to use this program.  Your kernel must be compiled to support the
"userspace" CPUFreq governor and the "sysfs" interface used by Linux 2.6.
CPUSpeed no longer supports the "proc" interface used by Linux 2.4. If you
need this please use version 1.2.x.

I use this program on my Dell and HP laptops and netbooks to increase
battery life and control performance.


To build:

    make

To install (as root):

    make install_redhat

   or

   make install_suse

   or

   make install_debian (not implemented yet)

After installation, edit and uncomment the "OPTS" line in the cpuspeed config
file (maybe /etc/sysconfig/cpuspeed or /etc/sysconfig/powersave/cpuspeed) if
you would like to specify any options when CPUSpeed is started.  You may also
edit the "DRIVER" line to specify the cpufreq driver the startup script should
attempt to load.

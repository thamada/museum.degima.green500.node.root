Example:
    cpuspeed -d -i 10 -t /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature 79 \
        -a /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ACAD/state

    This will have the program check (and possibly change) the CPU speed once
    every second and go to minimum CPU speed if the temperature goes above 79
    or the AC adapter is disconnected.

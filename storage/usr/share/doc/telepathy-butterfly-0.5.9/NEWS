telepathy-butterfly-0.5.9 (2010-04-24)
======================================

Enhancements:

 * libproxy can now be used to automatically retrieve proxy settings
   and give these settings to papyon. NOTE: the version of
   python-libproxy in Ubuntu (0.2.3) has a bug which makes butterfly
   segfault -- version 0.3.1 is known to work. (fd.o#27121)

Fixes:

 * fd.o#27555: butterfly crashed with KeyError in
   add_text_capabilities().

 * fd.o#27559: butterfly crashed with AttributeError in
   on_addressbook_contact_added().

 * fd.o #27776: Avatars: implement the properties from spec 0.17.22.

Dependencies:

 * Not a hard dependency, but python-libproxy is required if you want
   automatic proxy configuration to work. See the above note about
   python-libproxy versions.

telepathy-butterfly-0.5.8 (2010-04-08)
======================================

Enhancements:

 * Implement ContactCapabilities connection interface. (fd.o#27138)

 * Implement Messages text channel interface. (fd.o#27201)

 * Add support for HTTP connections. (fd.o#22508)

Fixes:

 * fd.o#27120: Register new connections with the CM so NewConnection
   is fired.

 * fd.o#27325: Make GetContactAttributes more tolerant. (Will)

 * fd.o#27122: Raise NotAvailable when started with an invalid
   contact.

telepathy-butterfly-0.5.7 (2010-03-22)
======================================

IF YOU'RE PACKAGING THIS THEN YOU SHOULD TOTALLY READ THIS OR YOU'LL
SCREW UP AND YOUR USERS WILL HATE YOU...

 1. We've moved from waf to autotools. This should be fairly obvious
    though.

 2. More importantly, contacts no longer have the annoying #1 suffix
    after their ID. The external network ID (which is Yahoo!) will
    appear to distinguish between MSN and Yahoo!. These IDs will have
    "#yahoo" appended.

    Now, this is great, but this obviously means that logs might be
    broken once users make the switch. I've written a little migration
    tool for Empathy that is performed automatically when it notices
    the user is running new butterfly. However, this is only in
    Empathy >= 2.29.92.

    If the user uses this butterfly release before using the new
    empathy, then initially the log viewer will be ugly with
    duplicates (#1 contacts, and non-#1 contacts), and when the user
    finally uses said Empathy version, there is a chance not all logs
    will be nicely migrated. Nothing should get lost, but really what
    you should do is make this version of butterfly conflict with an
    old Empathy. That's certainly what we're going to do in Debian.

If you don't heed this advice and then start filing bugs when your
users get annoyed, I will not be amused.

Enhancements:

 * GetInterfaces on the connection will now return before the
   connection status is CONNECTED which means Mission Control can see
   that we have the (simple)presence interface and set an initial
   presence that we should use once we become actually connected. This
   stops the annoying transition of always connected as invisible and
   then quickly changing to the value in RequestedPresence.

 * The build system has been switched from waf to autotools, so the
   people who actually hack on butterfly knows how the build system
   works. Fixes fd.o#27053

 * Contact IDs no longer have their network ID appended to their
   passport email address, as described above. Fixes fd.o#25635

Fixes:

 * fd.o#24699: Stop abusing (Message_Type_Action, "nudge") to send
   nudges.

 * fd.o#27120: Be sure to register any new connection with actual
   Connection Manager so it fires NewConnection.

telepathy-butterfly-0.5.6 (2010-03-12)
======================================

This release is the first release where the previous mess of 1-1
channels actually being unnamed MUCs is fixed! The conference channel
interface introduces a method to represent a channel as a continuation
of one or more than one other channel.

As a result of this work, proper MUC support now works. Users can now
invite other contacts, and be invited, to chatrooms.

Enhancements:

 * Implemented conference channel interface. Doing so also split up
   ButterflyTextChannel into a base text channel class, with the same
   name, and three subclasses. See the git logs for more
   information.

 * Copy the official client with respect to typing notifications.

Fixes:

 * Use escape_as_identifier in the channel manager so when we create
   group channels with characters that aren't safe for object paths,
   they are actually escaped.

Dependencies:

 * telepathy-python 0.15.17

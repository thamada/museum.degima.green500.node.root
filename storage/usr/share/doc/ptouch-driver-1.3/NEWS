* History:
  - This is the initial version.
  - It was written from scratch by Arne John Glenstrup, inspired from
    work done by Renaud Bompuis (http://etc.nkadesign.com/) on
    analysing the printer command codes for Brother P-touch QL-550,
    and work done by Geoffrey Teale on a printer driver for Brother
    P-touch 2420PC.
* Missing features:
  - Probably numerous, but mainly support for PT-PC and any other
    (probaly old) printers that use bit image printing.

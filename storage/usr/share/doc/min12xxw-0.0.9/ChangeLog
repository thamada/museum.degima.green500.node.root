revision history:

v. 0.0.0	(Jun  9 2004) initial revision based on Adam's driver

v. 0.0.1	(Jun 10 2004) fixed a bug when printing multipage
		documents directly to the printer (the printer rejects
		the data if the pauses between pages due to data processing
		on the host are	too long, solution: buffer output in
		temporary file)

v. 0.0.2	(Jun 14 2004) added correct treatment of margins

v. 0.0.3	(Jun 19 2004) added support for reading data from printer
		as well as a toner-saving mode, fixed a bug in 300 dpi
		output - this will be the version initially released to
		the public

v. 0.0.4	(Jun 20 2004) made the raster data compression even
		faster and improved the compression ratio somewhat

v. 0.0.5	(Jul 18 2004) little speedup in compression routine
		initial support for 13xxW series printers based on
		looking at output of windoof driver for 13xxW printers
		and suggestions and much help from David Hamilton
		<dhamilto@angel.homeip.net>

v. 0.0.6	(Oct  8 2004) min12xxw is now using GNU autoconf to adapt
		to different OSs/machines. I also added replacements for
		getline/getopt_long functions for systems that don't have
		them. (This was inspired by an e-mail from David Hupp
		<David@Hupp.com> who ran into problems trying to build on
		FreeBSD - we can't leave those FreeBSD people without a
		driver, can we?) Apparently this does also fix build problems
		on Mac OS X. min12xxw now has an FAQ document which should
		answer some frequently asked questions. I also made some
		tiny optimizations which should increase raster data
		compression speed a tiny little bit. Also, a temporary file
		to buffer the output is only created when not writing to a
		pipe or a regular file.

v. 0.0.7	(Apr 11 2005) some minor cleanups and fixes in the code,
		resulting in cleaner support for BSD-like systems which have
		fgetln instead of getline. Min12xxw used to build on MaxOS X,
		now it works on Mac OS X as well. ;) No functional changes.

v. 0.0.8	(Aug  5 2005) a few fixes making the code (hopefully) 64-bit
		clean. Check for gettext in libintl or standard C library is
		now done - compiling on NetBSD should be possible now. Apart
		from that no functional changes.

v. 0.0.9	(Dec 31 2005) a few code cleanups here and there, fixed a bug
		that was triggered by pages with very small dimensions (thanks
		go to Ben Cooper for his bug report), initial support for the
		1400W model (thanks go to Krishnaprasad for asking me to do
		it, and to Konica-Minolta in the Netherlands because it was
		the only web site that I managed to download a windoof driver
		from so I could have a look at the raw printer data produced
		by the windoof driver, besides I wish to thank the qemu
		developers for writing a virtual machine that allows one to
		drink a tea or two but not to grow a beard while waiting for
		the windoof 98 installation to complete on a G3 330 MHz)
		also updated esc-m, an utility to dump the raw data format
		used by all supported printers in a more human-readable way
		still, esc-m remains a hack and should only be used to
		analyse and debug raw data if really neccessary, for example
		raw data produced by windoof drivers for new models that
		min12xxw does not (yet) support

<p>Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be a subset of
the <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/">FAM</a> (File Alteration
Monitor) system. This is a service provided by a library which allows to
detect when a file or a directory has been modified.</p>

<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be a subset of
the <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/">FAM</a> (File Alteration
Monitor) system.</p>

<p>The main goals of the project are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>minimize the security model of FAM, the daemon runs under the user
    account, it is compatible with SELinux</li>
  <li>simplify the code base, dropping some of the most exotic feature of
  FAM</li>
  <li>provide an API and ABI compatible replacement for FAM</li>
  <li>try to fix some other issues like resource consumption</li>
</ol>

<p>Gamin also serves as an interface to test the inotify mechanism to improve
the existing dnotify monitoring interface present in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>At this point Gamin is fairly tied to Linux, portability is not a primary
goal at this stage but if you have portability patches they are welcome.</p>

<p>From an historical point of view, gamin builds from the marmot project
authored by James Willcox and Corey Bowers and then heavilly modified to turn
it into a minimalist FAM replacement (Francophones will appreciate the
filiation from fam to marmot and gamin.)</p>

<p>This library is available under the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE</a>, and a <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php">copy</a> of it
should be found in the source under the COPYING file.</p>

<h2><a name="Using">Using gamin</a></h2>

<p>Basically it is exactly like for using the fam interface. From a
programmer point of view this is the same API, and one can make use of
the existing FAM documentation.</p>

<h2><a name="Config">Configuration</a></h2>

<p>By default gamin should work without needing any configuration, but
sometimes using the kernel notification APIs doesn't work or lead to troubles
(for example when trying to unmount device). By default gamin revert to using
polling for all paths matching <code>/mnt/*</code> or <code>/media/*</code>
on Linux. This may be overriden or extended by the one of the three config files
<code>/etc/gamin/gaminrc</code>, <code>$HOME/.gaminrc</code>, <code>/etc/gamin/mandatory_gaminrc</code> (note that prior to 0.1.4 only <code>$HOME/.gaminrc</code> was used and fsset was not implemented).
Here is an example of such a configuration file:</p>
<pre># configuration for gamin
# Can be used to override the default behaviour.
# notify filepath(s) : indicate to use kernel notification
# poll filepath(s)   : indicate to use polling instead
# fsset fsname method poll_limit : indicate what method of notification for the filesystem
#                                  kernel - use the kernel for notification
#                                  poll - use polling for notification
#                                  none - don't use any notification
#                                  
#                                  the poll_limit is the number of seconds
#                                  that must pass before a resource is polled again.
#                                  It is optional, and if it is not present the previous
#                                  value will be used or the default.
 
notify /mnt/local* /mnt/pictures* # use kernel notification on these paths
poll /temp/*                      # use poll notification on these paths
fsset nfs poll 10                 # use polling on nfs mounts and poll once every 10 seconds
</pre>

<p>The configuration file accepts only 3 types of command:</p>
<ul>
  <li>notify : to express that kernel monitoring should be used for matching
    paths</li>
  <li>poll: to express that polling should be used for matching paths</li>
  <li>fsset: to control what notification method is used on a filesystem type</li>
</ul>


<p>The three config files are loaded in this order:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>/etc/gamin/gaminrc</code></li>
	<li><code>~/.gaminrc</code></li>
	<li><code>/etc/gamin/mandatory_gaminrc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The mandatory config file allows the system administrator to override any potentially dangerous preferences set by the user.</p>

<p>When checking a path to guess whether polling or kernel notification
should be used, gamin checks first the user provided rules in their
declaration order within the configuration file and then check the predefined
rules. This way the first declaration for <code>/mnt/local*</code> in the
example override the default one for <code>/mnt/*</code> .</p>
<p>If gamin is not told to use poll on a particular path, it will then try and decide based on the filesystem the path is located on</p>

<p><em>Caveat: separators in the config file should be spaces, not tabs.</em></p>

<p>You can download gamin from the GNOME project pages, either as <a

<h2><a name="Python">Python bindings</a></h2>
<p>Starting with release 0.0.21, gamin comes with Python bindings. Use "<span
style="font-family: monospace;">import gamin</span>"
to load the module. It exports the main class "<span
style="font-family: monospace;">WatchMonitor</span>"
which handle one connection to the gam_server. Once an instance of the
class has been created you can use the watch_directory and watch_file
methods to register objects to monitors, and provide the callback to be
called when events are generated. Like the FAM API, the python binding
API is passive, i.e. one need&nbsp; to&nbsp; monitor the file
descriptor provided with the <span
style="font-family: monospace;">get_fd()</span>
method to detect events, and call <span
style="font-family: monospace;">handle_one_event()</span>
(blocking) or <span
style="font-family: monospace;">handle_events()</span>
(non-blocking) to process incoming events and get the callbacks
appropriately. You can also use the <span
style="font-family: monospace;">event_pending()</span>
method to detect if <span
style="font-family: monospace;">handle_one_event()</span>
would block or not.<br>
Since a short example is worth a thousand words, here is a small
session from the python shell:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import gamin
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def callback(path, event):
...     print "Got callback: %s, %s" % (path, event)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; mon = gamin.WatchMonitor()
&gt;&gt;&gt; mon.watch_directory(".", callback)
&lt;gamin.WatchObject instance at 0xb7f7b56c&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; mon.event_pending()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; mon.handle_one_event()
Got callback: /u/veillard/temp, 8
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; mon.handle_events()
Got callback: bar1, 8
Got callback: foo1, 8
Got callback: /u/veillard/temp, 9
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; mon.stop_watch(".")
&gt;&gt;&gt; del mon
</pre>
<p>The corresponding standalone code follows:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env python

import gamin
import time

def callback(path, event):
    print "Got callback: %s, %s" % (path, event)

mon = gamin.WatchMonitor()
mon.watch_directory(".", callback)
time.sleep(1)
ret = mon.event_pending()
if ret &gt; 0:
    ret = mon.handle_one_event()
    ret = mon.handle_events()
mon.stop_watch(".")
del mon
</pre>
<p>Note the addition of the sleep timeout, it is needed because due to the round trip between the client and the gam_server, events may not be immediately available after the monitor creation to the client.</p>

<h3><a name="Debugging">Debugging support in gamin</a>:</h3>

<p>Both the client and server side, if compiled with debug support accept an
environment variable <strong>GAM_DEBUG</strong> which is set will make them
report debugging informations to stdout.</p>

<p>Usually for debugging you also want to use a dedicated server process so
setting the <strong>GAM_CLIENT_ID</strong> environment allows to ensure this.
Usually one also want to keep control over the server lifetime and not have
it exit automatically after 30 seconds without connection, there is a command
line flag <strong>--notimeout</strong> to <strong>gam_server</strong> for
this.</p>

<p>A typical example of a debugging session using 2 shells would be:</p>
<pre>shell1: export GAM_DEBUG=
shell1: gam_server --notimeout test</pre>

<p>to run the server in debug mode using the ID "test"</p>
<pre>shell2: export GAM_DEBUG=
shell2: export GAM_CLIENT_ID=test
shell2: gamin_client</pre>

<p>to run the client in a verbose session. It is perfectly possible to also
run the client under a debugger, for the server it works too except the
dnotify kernel interface uses a signal SIG33 which is trapped by gdb. To
avoid this use the handle gdb instruction:</p>

<h3><a name="Debugging1">Debugging a running program</a>:</h3>

<p>Both the gam_server and client of the gamin library can get switched
dynamically to a debug mode by sending them a signal SIGUSR2. In that case
the program or library switches to verbose debugging and outputs the traces
to a new file /tmp/gamin_debug_XXXXXX . Sending the signal again to the
application or the server should switch off debugging.</p>

<h3><a name="Debugging2">Debugging and testing client</a>:</h3>

<p>A debugging client program called <strong>testgam</strong> is also
available in the tests subdirectory. It allow to use the interface and
monitor the flow of event received. Here is an example of a session:</p>
<pre>paphio:~/gamin/tests -&gt; export GAMIN_DEBUG_SERVER="../server/gam_server"
paphio:~/gamin/tests -&gt; ./testgam -
&gt; connect test
connected to test
&gt;</pre>

<p>The environment variable can be used to specify the path to the server to
run, then <strong>testgam</strong> is launched in interactive mode (argument
<strong>-</strong> ) and the program is asked to connect to the server for
session test (the server will be started on-demand by the library if
needed).</p>
<pre>&gt; mkdir temp
mkdir temp
&gt; mkfile temp/foo
mkfile temp/foo
&gt; mondir temp
mondir temp 0
&gt;
1: /u/veillard/gamin/tests/temp Exists: NULL
1: foo Exists: NULL
1: /u/veillard/gamin/tests/temp EndExist: NULL
&gt; mkfile temp/bar
mkfile temp/bar
&gt;
1: bar Created: NULL
&gt; rmfile temp/foo
rmfile temp/foo
&gt;
1: foo Deleted: NULL
&gt;</pre>

<p>In this example a new directory is created with a file in it and then
monitored, then the directory content is modified. The
<strong>testgam</strong> program also poll and report events coming from the
server as they arrive.</p>

<h2><a name="Security">Security</a></h2>

<p>While gamin still use a server to provide the service (ideally if the
kernel had a proper interface a library only implementation should be doable
and possibly better), it tries to avoid security hazard associated to
contacting an external server process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the server runs under the same privilege level as the client, by
    running under the uid, no root or superuser access is involved, this is
    checked by both side using kernel support for the checking</li>
  <li>when possible (e.g. on Linux) the socket used to communicate is not
    mapped at the filesystem level to avoid risks related to opening a real
    file, if the kernel doesn't allow this a per user directory holding the
    socket is used and appropriate rights are checked.</li>
  <li>to limit DoS attacks done by continuously modifying a monitored
    resource, the daemon will switch back monitoring of very busy resources
    to polling with generation of events only once per second.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the process used to acquire and create the sockets:</p>

<h3>If there is abstract socket support:</h3>

<p>Use the filename "\0/tmp/fam-$USER-$GAM_CLIENT_ID". They are not mapped on
the filesystem, no attack is possible that way. The client and the server
checks on the first '\0' byte received from the socket that the other side is
running under the same UID.</p>

<h3>If there is no abstract socket support:</h3>

<p>On the server side:</p>
<pre> start:
  try to create /tmp/fam-$USER using mkdir('/tmp/fam-$USER', 007)
  if error:
      make a stat() on it
      if doesn't exist:
          return failure to create
      if user is not getuid() or mode is not 007 or type is not dir:
          try to unlink()
          if error:
              exit with error.
          if success:
              goto start:
                                                                                
  do the socket()/bind() on /tmp/fam-$USER/fam-$GAM_CLIENT_ID</pre>

<p>On the client side:</p>
<pre>  make a stat on /tmp/fam-$USER
  if doesn't exist:
      return failure to create should start the server
  if user is not getuid() or mode is not 007 or type is not dir:
      try to unlink()
      if error:
          exit with error.
      if success:
          return failure should start the server
  make a stat on /tmp/fam-$USER/fam-$GAM_CLIENT_ID
  if doesn't exist:
      return failure to create should start the server
  if user is not getuid() or type is not socket:
      try to unlink()
      if error:
          exit with error.
      if success:
          return failure should start the server
                                                                                
  do the socket()/connect() on /tmp/fam-$USER/fam-$GAM_CLIENT_ID</pre>

<p>The client and the server checks on the first '\0' byte received that the
other side is of the same UID.</p>

<h2><a name="Internals">Internals</a></h2>

<p>gamin uses a client server model, this is in a large measure justified by
the inappropriate dnotify kernel API way to signal modification events to an
application but also to share kernel signal when multiple application
monitors the same resource. It also allow to fine tune and filters event flow
in the daemon, potentially minimizing resource consumption in
applications.</p>

<p><img src="client_server.gif" alt="One server and two client connected"></p>

<p>Internally the gam_server maintain various data structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A tree of monitored nodes, using both GamNode structure containing
    specific informations (like the path, the subscriptions list for that
    node, monitoring data and whether it's a directory), the tree itself is
    based on a GNode N-ary tree.</li>
  <li>Per connection data (GamConnData) one per connected socket. The data
    includes state, connection informations (file descriptor, Glib I/O
    Channel, pid of the application), and potential unprocessed yet data
    request from the socket.</li>
  <li>Listener information, keeps the list of subscriptions for the connected
    application, this could probably be merged in the connection data.</li>
  <li>For each path monitored by an application, a specific GamSubscription
    structure is maintained. The subscriptions are referenced both from the
    monitored nodes tree and from the listeners.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Differences">Differences from FAM</a></h2>

<h3>Differences</h3>
<p>gamin should be binary and source code compatible with FAM 2.6.8.
However there are some differences and at least one significant 
extension.</p>
<p>The differences are in term of implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>No system wide server, instead it relies on per user server, if
needed started on demand by the fam/gamin library.</li>
<li>The functions FAMSuspendMonitor(), FAMResumeMonitor() and
    FAMMonitorCollection() are not implemented. They all raise problem
    of accumulating unbounded state on the server side and better handled
    at the client level if needed.</li>
<li>FAMErrno is provided, but the values may not match their FAM
counterparts, similary FamErrlist[] error messages are different.</li>
<li>No NFS support based on specific RPC and server, instead gamin monitors
only the state as reported locally by the kernel, not that locally done
changes on NFS or AFS filesystems are reported on Linux which is the
main criteria when having user home directories on such filesystems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Extension(s)</h3>
<p>We tried to limit changes in gamin but a number of features were
deemed more important than sticking to the exact same set than FAM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for inotify on Linux if compiled in the kernel, this override
most of the deficiencies related to dnotify.</li>
<li>A lot of debugging support was added both for client and server
see the <a href="debug.html">specific page</a> on the matter.</li>
<li>The possibility to block Exist/EndExists callbacks when monitoring
directories based on a new API, see below</li>
</ul>
<p>FAM when monitoring a directory, immediately send a set of events
listing the files found in that directory, this ends up with an EndExists
events. However when monitoring hierarchy it's usually far more efficient
and simple to do the scanning on the client side and ignore those 
directory listing events from the FAM server (the only drawback is a potential
mismatch of the directory content between the FAM server and the client).
In such a case, all those events are not only superfluous but they are
also dangerous since they can lead to a congested pipe to the client
which is just scanning directories and not listening to FAM. To that
intent we added in gamin 0.0.23 a new API disabling the Exists/EndExists
sequences when watching directories for a given FAMConnection:</p>
<pre>int FAMNoExists(FAMConnection *fc)</pre>
<p>and with the Python bindings:</p>
<pre>WatchMonitor.no_exists()</pre>
<p>This feature is also used when the client reconnect to the server
after a connection loss or if the server died.</p>
<p>Calling it changes the protocol as described below, directory 
monitoring from that call will only get mutation events and not
the initial lists:</p>

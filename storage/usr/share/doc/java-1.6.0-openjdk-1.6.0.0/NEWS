  packed into given handle. This increases stability and breaks
  reliance on the assumption that the browser will always provide a
  handle in a certain sequence.

  specifications.

  by Firefox >= 3.6), the new plugin is required and the build will
  automatically enable it if the old plugin is requested.
- Support added for building with HotSpot 16 using
  --with-hotspot-build=hs16.  This is the same as was released
  in the proprietary JDK6 update 18.
- Zero port updated to match the version submitted to OpenJDK
  as closely as possible.
- libjpeg7, libjpeg8, libpng 1.4 and libXext >= 1.1.0 supported.

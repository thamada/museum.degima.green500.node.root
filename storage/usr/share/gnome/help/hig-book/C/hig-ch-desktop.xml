	Do not add launchers or other icons to the desktop when your application is installed.  The desktop is the user&apos;s space, and is reserved for icons that they explicitly request or add themselves.

       <para>The <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu, which appears on the panel at the top of the screen by default, is the primary mechanism by which users discover and run applications.  You place entries in this menu by installing an appropriate <filename>.desktop</filename> file.</para>

    <para>The menu is arranged into a set of categories, such as Accessories and Games. Applications are placed in particular categories by the set of keywords they include in their <filename>.desktop</filename> file. </para>

	<title>Include a functional description in the menu name</title>

	<para>In the menu item name, include a description of functionality in addition to the proper name of the application. This is especially useful novice users, and to users of systems where numerous applications are installed by default. Users are more likely to find your application if the name that appears in the menu includes a description of its functionality.</para>

	<para>For example, <ulink url="http://web.mit.edu/is/usability/aui/">user testing of MIT&apos;s Athena system</ulink> revealed that users had difficulty finding the file manager because they were unfamiliar with the name &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Because users did not associate the word &quot;Nautilus&quot; with the concept &quot;file manager&quot; the menu item did not help them. This is an example of not using the user&apos;s language. See <xref linkend="principles-match"/> for more on this topic.</para>

	<title>Generic Name and Name</title>

        <para>There are two name types required for a menu item, a generic name and a proper name.  The menu item requires these two names to distinguish the applications when there are more than one of the same application type present and to simplify the item name when there is only one present.  If only one application of a generic name exists in the menu the application assumes the generic name, otherwise the proper name is displayed.</para>

	<example>
		<title>X-Chat .desktop file</title>
		 <programlisting>
	Name=X-Chat IRC
	GenericName=IRC
		 </programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>
	The generic name or GenericName, is a name describing only the applications functionality without the applications proper name.  This is the name to be displayed when there are no other applications of the same generic name present and should simply describe the pure functionality of the application without its actual name.
	</para>

	<para>
	A proper name or Name, is the displayed name of the application when there are more than one applications present with the same generic name.  This distinguishes the multiple generic names with the applications proper name.

    <title>Mapping Document Types to Applications</title>
    
    <para>The document type (MIME) database allows users to specify their preferred applications for opening different types of document. This is the mechanism by which Nautilus, Evolution and other applications decide which application to run when they encounter a document they cannot open themselves.</para>

    <para>It is important for users to be able to double-click on documents they see on the desktop, such as files and email messages, and have them launch in their favorite application.  Therefore, your GNOME application should associate itself at install-time with all the document types it can handle. Technical details on doing this can be found in the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gnome-vfs"><citetitle>GnomeVFS API reference</citetitle></ulink>.</para>

			 This release includes <package>mod_fcgid</package> 2.3.4, the first non-beta release from its new home as part of the Apache httpd project. There should be no compatibility problems with existing applications designed to work with older versions of <package>mod_fcgid</package> but the configuration directives of <package>mod_fcgid</package> itself have all been renamed to avoid any potential conflicts with other parts of the Apache httpd project. This means that users updating from older releases may need to edit their <package>mod_fcgid</package> configuration: a script "<filename>fixconf.sed</filename>" is included in the <package>mod_fcgid</package> package to convert configurations from the old directive names to the new ones.

		Fedora provides legacy system libraries for compatibility with older software. This software is part of the Legacy Software Development group, which is not installed by default. Users who require this functionality may select this group either during installation or after the installation process is complete. To install the package group on a Fedora system, use <guimenu>Applications</guimenu><guimenuitem>Add/Remove Software</guimenuitem> or enter the following command in a terminal window: 
<screen>
      <command>su -c &#39;yum groupinstall "Legacy Software Development"&#39;</command>

	  In support of free culture, the open web, and to reduce the
	  hold of proprietary and patent-encumbered codecs, Red Hat
	  has been sponsoring improvements on the open Ogg Theora
	  video codec implementation codenamed <application>Thusnelda</application> via
	  Christopher Montgomery (xiphmont), who created the format
	  and work has resulted in drastic improvements to the
	  codec. This release features this next generation codec,
	  compared to <application>libtheora 1.0</application>, the new encoder can produce
	  comparable quality encodings at a lower bitrate, or better
	  quality at the same bitrate. All applications using
	  <application>libtheora</application> library including all the <application>GStreamer</application> applications
	  will automatically and transparently be taking advantage of
	  the improvements.

	  <application>Fedora Studio</application> is an optional multimedia menus package that
	  allows users to have their audio and video
	  applications classified in their desktop menu. In previous
	  versions of Fedora, all multimedia applications were in one
	  large group. This package makes it easier for users to
	  navigate audio and video applications.

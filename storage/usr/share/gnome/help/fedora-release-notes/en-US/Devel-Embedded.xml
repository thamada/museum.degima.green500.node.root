  <para>
    Fedora &PRODVER; includes a range of packages to support
    development of embedded applications on various
    targets. There is broad support for the AVR and related
    parts as well as for the Microchip PIC. In addition, there
    are packages to support development on older, less popular
    parts such as the Z80, 8051, and others. For a more complete
    description refer to <citetitle>Packages
    for embedded development on the wiki</citetitle> available at <ulink type="http"
    url="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packages_For_Embedded_Development"></ulink> .

	<para>
	  <package>gnusim8085</package> is new to Fedora. GNUSim8085
	  is a graphical simulator for Intel 8085 microprocessor
	  assembly language. It has some very nice features including
	  a keypad which can be used to write assembly language
	  programs with much ease. It also has stack, memory and port
	  viewers which can be used for debugging the programs.

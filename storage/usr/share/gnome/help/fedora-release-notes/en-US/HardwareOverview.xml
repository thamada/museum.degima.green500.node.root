	The minimum memory listed below may not be sufficient for all
	situations.  In particular, installation in a virtual machine
	may require memory closer to the "Recommended" value.

      The following CPU specifications are stated in terms of Intel
      processors. Other processors, such as those from AMD, Cyrix, and
      VIA that are compatible with and equivalent to the following
      Intel processors, may also be used with Fedora. Fedora &PRODVER;
      requires an Intel Pentium Pro or better processor, and is optimized
      for i686 and later processors.

    <para>
      The complete packages can occupy over 9 GB of disk space. Final
      size is entirely determined by the installing spin and the
      packages selected during installation. Additional disk space is
      required during installation to support the installation
      environment. This additional disk space corresponds to the size
      of /Fedora/base/stage2.img (on Installation Disc 1) plus the
      size of the files in /var/lib/rpm on the installed system.
    </para>
    <para>
      In practical terms, additional space requirements may range from
      as little as 90 MiB for a minimal installation to as much as an
      additional 175 MiB for a larger installation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Additional space is also required for any user data, and at
      least 5% free space should be maintained for proper system
      operation.

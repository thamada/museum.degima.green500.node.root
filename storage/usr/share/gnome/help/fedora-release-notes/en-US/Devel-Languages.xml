  <para>
    Fedora&nbsp;&PRODVER; includes all of the popular programming
    languages.  This section outlines the major changes since 
    Fedora&nbsp;&PREVVER;. Since Fedora tries to include the lastest of everything from
    upstream, there are, of course, many minor changes.  See the
    tables at the end of this document for details.

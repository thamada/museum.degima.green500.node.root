    Fedora &PRODVER; includes a complete set of applications for
    schematic capture, circuit simulation, and PCB layout.  The
    following are major changes to these applications.  A complete
    list of changes may be found at the end of this document.

	  In Fedora 12, the <package>geda</package> suite, previously
	  packaged as a number of individual applications, is now provided
	  in a single, complete package.

	</indexterm>
	<para>
	  Fedora’s <package>gspiceui</package> is now compiled under
	  <package>wxgtk</package> 2.8 instead of the old
	  <package>wxgtk</package> 2.6. This improves GSpiceUIi’s GUI
	  interface.  GSpiceUI includes missing opamp-3.sym to
	  /usr/share/gEDA/sym/misc/ (geda symbols directory).
	  <note>
	    <title>PPC64</title>
	    <para>
	      GSpiceUI is not available on Fedora supported PPC64
	      architecture as a result of missing gwave for that
	      architecture.

	<para>
	  <package>tclspice</package> is new to Fedora &PRODVER;.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Before ngspice-rework-19, Fedora has considered
	  <package>tclspice</package>’s stability too fragile.
	  Examples of <package>tclspice</package> can be found via
	  <command>rpm -qd tclspice</command>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Tclspice provides Fedora users with extended capabilities
	  for mixed-signal design via its TCL backend. Since Fedora is
	  also providing tools for boolean manipulation (explained in
	  the following section), Fedora users have adequate materials
	  to spin his or her own mixed-signal EDA plugin.

	  <package>xcircuit</package> has been updated to version

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Supports multiple schematic layout windows.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A complete overhaul of the key-function binding
		routines and the function dispatch mechanism was
		effected.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Several additions and corrections need to be made to
		make the multiplewindow implementation work properly.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The way libraries are handled by making the
		distinction between library pages and files using the
		concept of "technology namespaces" has improved.  Each
		object has a name composed of a "technology prefix", a
		double colon ("::"), and the object’s name. Each
		library file declares a technology name, which is used
		as the prefix for all objects in that file.  The
		prefixes are used by XCircuit to track which objects
		came from which file, regardless of the library page
		onto which they were loaded. Added support for wires
		connected to symbol pins remain connected while the
		symbol is moved. It also expands upon the "Attach-to"
		function, allowing wires to be (semi-) automatically
		attached to pin labels or symbol pins.  The key macro
		for "attach-to" (key "A") can also be used like the
		"wire" function (key "w") to start a wire with its
		start-point attached to a symbol pin or pin label.

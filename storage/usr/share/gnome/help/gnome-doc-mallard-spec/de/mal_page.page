<p>The <code>page</code> element is the root element of any Mallard page file.
In Mallard, documents are composed of discrete pages which are  interlinked
using various linking mechanisms.  There are two types of pages in Mallard:
<link xref="#guide">guide pages</link> and <link xref="#topic">topic pages</link>.
Topic pages contain the bulk of the material discussed in a document, whereas
guide pages serve as navigational aids.</p>

    any number of <code xref="mal_section">section</code> elements.</p></item>

    <item><p>The <code>page</code> element is the top-level element in any

    the page.</p></item>

    <item><p>The <code>type</code> attribute takes the values <code>"guide"</code> and
    <code>"topic"</code>.  <link xref="#guide">Guide pages</link> and <link xref="#topic">topic
    pages</link> are discussed below.  If the <code>type</code> attribute is
    omitted, it is assumed to be <code>"topic"</code>.</p></item>

    <item><p>The <code>style</code> attribute takes a space-separated list of

  <title>Guide Pages</title>

  <p>Guide pages have the <code>type</code> attribute set to
  <code>"guide"</code>.  They serve as navigational aids, linking to topics and
  other guides.  Readers can can browse through guides much as they would browse
  through container sections in a linear document.  Since page can be included
  in multiple guides, however, readers are able to reach the same content by
  navigating different paths.</p>

  <p>Guide pages have links automatically inserted into their content based
  on topic links within their own <code xref="mal_info">info</code> elements
  and guide links within the <code>info</code> elements of other pages and
  sections.  Guide pages can contain sections to help organize content.  Each
  section in a guide page has automatic links inserted as well.  See
  <link xref="links#topic"/> for details on automatic topic links.</p>

  <p>Guides also have see also links generated automatically.  See
  <link xref="links#seealso"/> for more information.</p>

  <p>Generally, guide pages will contain some introductory content to help
  readers understand the topics being presented.  Introductory content should
  be short and concise.</p>

<!-- BEGIN topic -->
<section id="topic">
  <title>Topic Pages</title>

  <p>Topic pages have the <code>type</code> attribute set to
  <code>"topic"</code>, or have no <code>type</code> attribute at all.  Topics
  contain the bulk of the material in a document.  A Topic may be a tutorial,
  a conceptual overview, reference material, or any other type of content.
  Mallard does not distinguish between different content types, although tools
  may introduce special styling based on style hints.  Topics are distinguished
  from guides only in that their primary purpose is to convey information,
  whereas guides serve as navigational aids.</p>

  <p>Topic pages have links automatically inserted to all guides which link
  to them.  Topic pages can contain sections to help organize material and
  present finer-grained chunks of information to the reader.  Each section
  in a topic page has automatic guide links inserted as well.  See
  <link xref="links#guide"/> for details on automatic guide links.</p>

  <p>Topics also have see also links generated automatically.  See
  <link xref="links#seealso"/> for more information.</p>

  <title>Processing Expectations</title>

  <p>In on-screen media, a <code>page</code> element is displayed as a single
  page.  In this case, <em>page</em> is used in the sense of <em>web page</em>:
  something which can be read top-to-bottom by scrolling.  This should not be
  confused with physical pages — one side of a leaf of paper — or with any
  fixed-height electronic pages such as those used by word processors and
  e-books.</p>

  <p>The <code>info</code> child element is not displayed directly, although
  certain informational elements may be displayed or affect aspects of the
  page display.  In particular, the <code>info</code> element may contain
  <code>link</code> elements which will cause automatic links to be inserted
  into the displayed output.  See <link xref="links"/> for more information.</p>

  <p>The title of a page is displayed prominently at the top, followed by any
  child block content, and finally by each child section.  Note that automatic
  links, style hints, or other special features may insert material or change
  the way pages are displayed.</p>

		<term id="saxon">Saxon genitive</term> 
		<listitem> 
		  <para>
			 A language construction that denotes possession, derived from Old
			 Saxon. The construction is present in all languages that have a distinct
			 Germanic influence, including English. The genitive form is not present in
			 Latin-derived languages, or non-European languages, and can therefore cause
			 difficulty for readers and translators. The genitive form is created by adding
			 apostrophe s to the end of a proper noun. In the original form, the genitive
			 was created by adding an -es suffix to a noun. The apostrophe in the English
			 form of the genitive denotes the missing letter e.

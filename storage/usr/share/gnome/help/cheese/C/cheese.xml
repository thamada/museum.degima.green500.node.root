  &app; uses your webcam to take photos and videos, applies
  fancy special effects and lets you share the fun with others.
  </para>

<section id="using">
  <title>Usage</title>
  <para>
    The main screen of &app; supports two different layouts at the moment.
		The default looks like the screenshot below, it has the preview image centered and
		the thumbnail slideshow below.
  </para>

      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>
	
	<para>
		Especially for &app;-users with small displays, like the ones in netbooks, we have designed
		another view. It is more horizontally aligned, in order to fit better on small widescreen displays.
		The wide-view is shown in the screenshot below.
	</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>

  <para>
    &app; uses the photo mode by defaults, but you can change this to use the video 
    or burst mode if desired.
  </para>

  <section id="using-effects">
    <title>Effects</title>
    <para>
      To apply effects to the input of your webcam, click
      the button labelled <guibutton>Effects</guibutton>. When you then go to
      the effects window, you will see a window similar to the image below.
      <figure>
        <title>&app; effects screenshot</title>
        <screenshot>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
       </screenshot>
      </figure>

    </para>

    <para>
      You can apply some really cool effects to your photos too! Just choose 
      from the several different effects available and click its corresponding
      button to apply it to your photo. Selecting multiple effects will apply 
      all the effects to your image. For example, if you select 
      <guibutton>Hulk</guibutton> and <guibutton>Vertical Flip</guibutton>, 
      the input from the webcam will be altered to have a green shade and be 
      upside down. To disable all effects, just click on the 
      <guibutton>No Effect</guibutton> button.
    </para>
		
		<para>
			To return to the preview of your webcam, just push the button 
            labelled <guibutton>Effects</guibutton> again. This will toggle 
            the Effects menu and bring you back to the normal view.
		</para>
  </section>

  <section id="using-photomode">
    <title>Photo Mode</title>
    <para>
      Photo mode is the default mode for &app;. When not in photo mode,
      click the button that shows the icon of a single photo or select it from the menu:
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Cheese</guimenu><guimenuitem>Photo</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
      to change to photo mode.
      Photo mode will take a single photo every time the button labelled
      <guibutton>Take a photo</guibutton> or the <keycap>Spacebar</keycap>
      key is pressed, and will save to disk.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="using-videomode">
    <title>Video Mode</title>
    <para>
      Video mode is a mode that allows you to take short videos using the webcam.
      When not in video mode, click the button that shows the icon of a film roll 
      or select it from the menu:
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Cheese</guimenu><guimenuitem>Video</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to
      change to video mode. Video mode will start recording a video every time 
      the button labelled <guibutton>Start Recording</guibutton> or the
      <keycap>Spacebar</keycap> is pressed. The video will stop
      recording and save to disk when the button labelled <guibutton>Stop
      Recording</guibutton> or the <keycap>Spacebar</keycap> is pressed.
    </para>

    <para>
      The video mode does not look much different from the photo mode,
      except that the button labelled <guibutton>Take a photo</guibutton> will
      say  <guibutton>Start Recording</guibutton> or <guibutton>Stop Recording</guibutton>,
      and the button with the film roll icon is pushed in, whereas the other 
      mode buttons (photo and burst) are not.
    </para>
	</section>
	
	<section id="using-burstmode">
    <title>Burst Mode</title>
    <para>
      In burst mode you can take more pictures in a row. It works exactly like 
      the photo mode, except that it takes a series of pictures. When you are 
      not in burst mode, click the button that shows the icon of several 
      pictures in a row or select it from the menu: <menuchoice><guimenu>Cheese</guimenu><guimenuitem>Burst</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to
      change to burst mode. Burst mode will start to take a series of 
      pictures with an interval of some seconds in between photos when the 
      button labelled <guibutton>Take Multiple Photos</guibutton> or the 
      <keycap>Spacebar</keycap> key is pressed.
      The delay and amount of pictures to take can be set in the preferences 
      dialog. For more information please see <xref linkend="preferences"/>.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        All modes can be used in fullscreen. To do this, click the 
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Cheese</guimenu><guimenuitem>Fullscreen</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu to
        enter fullscreen mode, or press the <keycap>F11</keycap> key. To exit fullscreen
        mode, press the <keycap>Esc</keycap> or the <keycap>F11</keycap> keys.

    <title>Taking a photo</title>
    <para>
      To take a photo with &app;, be sure to be in the “Photo” mode.
    </para>

    <para>
      It's easy to take photos with special effects. Just click the button
      labelled <guibutton>Effects</guibutton>, and click on the effects desired as
      described in <xref linkend="using-effects"/>. You should now have the effects that
      you chose applied to the webcam input. Press the effects button again to 
      get back to the normal view.
    </para>

    <para>
      To take a photo, press the button labelled <guibutton>Take a photo</guibutton>
      or press the <keycap>spacebar</keycap> key. Alternatively, you can also use 
      the webcam capture button, if your webcam has one. You will then
      see &application; count down from 3 or instantly take the photo, 
      depending on your settings. When the photo is taken, your entire screen
      will flash white, and the photo that was just taken will appear in the photo
      stream at the bottom of the program's window. To abort the countdown you can use the
      <keycap>Esc</keycap> key.
    </para>

  <section id="recordingavideo">
    <title>Recording a video</title>
    <para>

      button has been pressed.
    </para>

    <para>
      To start recording a video, press the button labelled <guibutton>Start
      Recording</guibutton> or press the <keycap>Spacebar</keycap> key. Alternatively,
      you can also use the webcam capture button, if your webcam has one.
      To stop recording just press the same button, now labelled <guibutton>Stop
      Recording</guibutton>, and the recording will stop and the video saved.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        If your video appears to be jerky or has a low
        frame rate (only updating the picture every few seconds), it does not mean that the recording
        has a similar frame rate. In many cases, the recorded file will have a better frame rate.
      </para>

      &app; stores your pictures in a folder called Webcam inside the
      XDG-Directory set for Pictures (in most distributions its ~/Pictures/Webcam).
      The same applies for Videos: ~/Videos/Webcam. XDG is a standard to
      declare default folders in your system. You can find more information
      about XDG <ulink url="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html" type="http">here</ulink>.

    <para>
      If the XDG-Path is not set on your System, cheese has a fallback solution: it
      will store both your pictures and videos in ~/.gnome2/cheese/media. This is the default
      directory for your media if you have an older version of &application;.

    <title>"No Camera Found" Error Message</title>
    <para>
      "When I launch &app;, I get the message 'No Camera Found' but I have my webcam plugged into my computer".

      There are many situations that can cause this, and the exact problem that is causing it needs to be isolated.
      If possible, try each of the following to try and get your webcam working:
        1. Plug your webcam into another computer. If it works there, then it is a problem 
           with the connection to your computer, or the operating system if it was a different
           one on the other computer. Check the ports on your computer (try another one) and
           consult support for your particular operating system.
        2. See if your camera is being detected by your computer. On Linux, open up the terminal or console and type
           "dmesg" before you plug in your webcam. Notice the most recent entries, and then plug in your webcam. Type
           "dmesg" again and see if the most recent entries differ. If the message mentions a USB device being detected,
           and your webcam is the only USB device that has been changed, then your computer is detecting your webcam
           fine. If not, then test to see if the webcam is working on another computer. This may only work with USB
           webcams.
        3. As &app; uses the gstreamer backend, it is most likely because gstreamer is not detecting the webcam (or
           gstreamer has become corrupt). Please contact support for the particular operating system that
           you are running with as many details as possible. For Ubuntu, please use the <ulink url="http://ubuntuforums.org/" type="http">Ubuntu Forums</ulink>.

  <section id="faq-supported-webcams">
    <title>Which cameras are supported?</title>
    <para>
      &app; uses gstreamer for video grabbing. So in principle &app; supports 
      any camera that works with GStreamer. That should be any camera
      which supports video4linux or video4linux2.

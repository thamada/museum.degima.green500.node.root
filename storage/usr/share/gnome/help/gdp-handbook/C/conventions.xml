  <sect2 id="guidelines-xmlcomp">
	<title>XML Requirements</title>
	<para>
	  All GNOME documentation should conform to XML syntax
	  requirements, which are stricter than SGML ones.
	</para>
  </sect2> 

  <include href="sectids.xml" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>
  
  <sect2 id="guidelines-authorsnames"> 
	<title>Authors' Names</title>
	<para> 
	  All GNOME documentation should contain the names of all 
	  documentation authors who have worked on the document.  The 
	  email address of all authors should also be included.  Even if 
	  you totally rewrote the documentation you still need to include 
	  the names of any authors of previous documentation for the 
	  specific application, applet, component, or widget.
	</para>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2 id="guidelines-license">
	<title> Copyright Information </title> 
	<para> Application
	  documentation should contain a copyright notice, stating the
	  licensing terms. It is suggested that you use the GNU Free
	  Documentation License.  You could also use some other license
	  allowing free redistribution, such as GPL or Open Content
	  license.  If documentation uses some trademarks (such as UNIX,
	  Linux, Windows, etc.), proper legal junk should also be
	  included (see templates).
	</para>
	<para>
	  If there is existing documentation then the author's copyright 
	  notice and license must be used.  This is to ensure that licenses 
	  and copyrights stay intact from version to version of the 
	  application and documentation.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you decide to use the GNU Free Documentation License, then all 
	  you need to do include the file <filename>legal.xml</filename> 
	  as a system entity (see templates).  Otherwise you need to 
	  mark up the license you are going to use and include it in place 
	  of <filename>legal.xml</filename>.
	</para>		
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="guidelines-revhistory">
	<title>Revision History</title>
	<para>
	  All GNOME documentation should contain the names of all 
	  previous documentation titles along with the current title for 
	  the documentation.  The current documentation title should indicate 
	  the version of the documentation.  The revision history should also 
	  contain the authors and their email addresses for the documentation 
	  they wrote and the publisher of the documentation.  This allows 
	  anybody to see how many revision the current documentation has 
	  undergone.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The revision history can also contains notes in the description 
	  for the specific version of the documentation.  If the author 
	  rewrote the documentation from scratch this should be indicated 
	  in the revision description.  Any extra descriptions need to be 
	  carried over to a new version of the documentation &mdash; see 
	  the templates for an example.
	</para>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2 id="guidelines-applicationversionid">
	<title>Application Version Identification</title>
	<para>
	  Application documentation should identify the version of the
	  application for which the documentation is written.  This 
	  information should be included in the <sgmltag>&lt;releaseinfo&gt;</sgmltag>
	  tag:
	  <programlisting>

  <sect2 id="guidelines-publishername">
	<title>Publisher's Name</title>
	<para>
	  All GNOME documentation must include information about the 
	  publisher of the document.  This will always be the GNOME 
	  Documentation Project (see templates).
	</para>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2 id="guidelines-styleguide">
	<title>GNOME Documentation Style Guide</title>
	<para>
	  The GNOME Documentation Style Guide should be followed at all 
	  times in writing and editing GNOME Documentation.  It contains 
	  writing tips, word usage, and grammatical errors common in 
	  technical writing.  You should read it before you start writing 
	  and use it as the authoritative resource for writing style.  To 
	  obtain a copy of the GNOME Documentation Style Guide go to 
	  <ulink url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdp-style-guide/stable/">
		http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdp-style-guide/stable</ulink>

  <sect2 id="guidelines-license2">
	<title>Software License</title>
	<para> 
	  All GNOME applications must contain information about the
	  license (for software, not for documentation), either in the
	  <quote>About</quote> box or in the manual.

  <sect2 id="guidelines-bugtraq">
	<title> Bug Reporting</title>
